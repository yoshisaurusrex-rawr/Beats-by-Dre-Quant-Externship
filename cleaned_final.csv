R1TIU27G892G8N,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best for modern music; fine for general purpose use,Glut & Lack: troublemaking twins,5.0,"Love this little speaker for the music I (and most of us) listen to. Extremely bass heavy, so it's great for the thumping stuff; not sure it would do well for classical music.Even with adjustment, it's a little muddy for voices (eg, audible books), but it does the job. If I'm gonna compromise, it'll be on that, not on music.So, I am entirely happy with it as an all-purpose speaker. It connects fast and reliably and has plenty range (past most people's normal listening distance).It's compact and robust. Very happy that its controls can be distinguished in the dark and be used without worries even when I'm wearing gloves or have damp, dirty hands.I got lucky with a Black Friday deal.Oh, and a lot of choices for cases exist. I wanted a stash case - not while-in-use - with full protection. The clamshell cases are cute, and some are offered in (possibly) matching colors. But I didn't want to fiddle with a long stitched hinge and a cornered zipper (both presenting stress points) so I kept looking and found a cylindrical case with a top that zips open. It fits the FLIP 6 perfectly.Worpie Carrying Travel Case for Flip 6 Flip 5 Flip 4 Flip 3 Portable Speakerhttps://a.co/d/abH8lV3","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2025",AEMU5GYR7E7YH5B64AKBUNZ5Y4PA,1,19,"Color: Blue, Style: Flip 6","January 14, 2025",2025-01-14,2025-01,JBL,"JBL Flip 6 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker, IPX7 Waterproof"

For listening to music in the living room or outside, the Flip 6 is really good, but when I watch movies or podcasts with the volume turned down, I still have trouble hearing conversations, because the application allows you to reduce bass and increase it but it doesn't really allow you to increase treble, yet I was shocked when I used the VLC equalizer, I heard every detail in the movies because the sound was clear, even when the volume was low, I hope JBL can fix this in an update, it would be great.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2025",AEGHFADTYNJTXTDHIYGI2RWKPJEQ,1,2,"Color: Camo, Style: Flip 6","April 7, 2025",2025-04-07,2025-04,JBL,"JBL Flip 6 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker, IPX7 Waterproof"

When I do this, I rotate the speaker to determine the best placement for sound quality while on the floor.I really like how easy it is to set up as well as how portable it is. I have even used this in my car to listen to an audio book on my phone.I think it is a great value for its price, especially since it compares favorably to some Sonos speakers I also own.

The mids are not there and the app doesn't have that much of customization. It claims to be drop proof and water proof. I did drop it in a pool and it survived but I have doubts about dropping it on a floor because of the size of this speaker. Also, for this big of a speaker the sound is not matching the size. It doesn't sound full and the max volume is not that loud for the size. The battery like is pretty good but again, at the max volume the sound gets bit noisy and the battery drops pretty fast.

R1V1VE2DAH2VT4,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and perfect gift,Daniel,5.0,"I bought the JBL Charge 5 as a Christmas gift for my partner, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. They‚Äôve been using it nonstop ever since, and we‚Äôre both really impressed by how powerful and clear the sound is for such a compact speaker. The bass is strong without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are crisp even at higher volumes. It‚Äôs loud enough to fill a room or even use outdoors without losing audio quality. We‚Äôve used it for everything from morning podcasts to evening backyard hangouts, and it delivers every time.One of the standout features is the battery life. We easily get a full day‚Äôs use out of it, and the fact that it can charge other devices with the built-in powerbank feature is a huge bonus. It‚Äôs convenient not having to pack an extra charger when we‚Äôre on the go.Pairing is simple and fast with Bluetooth, and the JBL PartyBoost feature is great if you have more JBL speakers to link up for a bigger sound.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5.0,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,1,163,Color: Black,"April 5, 2024",2024-04-05,2024-04,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

Premium sound in a small package.,Emery G,5.0,"After years of experimenting with various Bluetooth speakers, I finally decided to invest in the Bose SoundLink Flex, and I can confidently say it was worth every penny. This compact speaker has completely redefined my expectations for portable audio.Right out of the box, the SoundLink Flex exudes quality.The rugged, soft-touch exterior feels durable and ready for any adventure, while the sleek design is undeniably Bose. But it's the sound that truly sets this speaker apart.The audio performance is astonishing for its size. The bass is surprisingly deep and punchy, the mids are clear and detailed, and the highs are crisp without being harsh.What truly impressed me, however, is the PositionIQ technology. The speaker automatically adjusts its sound profile depending on its orientation, whether it's standing upright, lying flat, or hanging by its utility loop. This seamless adaptation ensures optimal sound quality in any situation, a feature I've found incredibly useful.The battery life is excellent, easily lasting through a full day of listening, and the Bluetooth connectivity is rock-solid. The IP67 rating provides peace of mind, knowing it can withstand dust and water, making it perfect for outdoor use.While the price point is higher than some other Bluetooth speakers, the Bose SoundLink Flex delivers a premium audio experience that justifies the investment. If you're looking for a portable speaker that combines exceptional sound quality, rugged durability, and intelligent features, the Bose SoundLink Flex is a clear winner. It's a pocket rocket of premium sound that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2025",AE2IREULAGW6VLDHQ6STH7LPFBUQ,1,17,Color: Blue Dusk,"March 23, 2025",2025-03-23,2025-03,Bose,Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen) - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

After reading reviews I decided on the Bose and wow, I'm glad I did. I've had other Bose products and regard the brand as among the upper echelon of sound equipment. For a very reasonable price the SoundLink Flex is impressive.Highs and mid-range are clear, and low-end is more substantial than expected fora compact design. The sound quality from such a small unit is amazing.Bluetooth connectivity to my iMac was a snap.

R1F2LZ4LGIUTPN,B0D6WD2QSQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome little speaker with great sound,Jimbo,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. My last small speaker was a skull candy air raid and back over 10 years ago it was awesome. I gifted the SC speaker to my daughter years back. Then I went and got a JBL partybox100 and love the darn thing but it is heavy. I knew I needed a small portable speaker for when I grill or I an in the garage working on something. I wanted clear sound on a small portable package that could fill a small room. I immediately went to check the JBL portable speakers around the same size. I sampled several but I really liked the sound of the Bose. I never had any bose anything before. It was going for $119 and it has an app to control the features on the speaker. It is very light weight for the size, I wanted something other than black and went with the blue. The construction feels good, it‚Äôs waterproof and shock resistant. The bluetooth picked up right away. I walked outside my house with my phone and never lost connectivity. Now the battery life, this is not for the whole day. If you have the EQ setting with a lower bass setting at 70% volume you are loosing 10% charge around every hour it was my estimation. So at a good high volume you can get a good solid 8-9 hours of play. If you have it lets say on your desk close to you at a 20% volume you might get the 12 hours. Now you can play while charging, it might take longer to charge but you will still get to enjoy your music. Charge cable provided is a usb-c to usb-a but you can use a usb-c to usb-c cable with any wall charger 12watt or higher. Match your cable watt rating to your wall plug watt rating. Meaning its better to have a higher rated cable than your wall plug. Example: 20watt wall plug with 60 watt usb-c cable its all you need. Buy quality chargers and cables Anker is one of my preferred brands. Highly recommend getting the free Bose app as it will update the software of your speaker when ever it drops and you can adjust your EQ settings. If you want a thumper go with a JBL it puts out more bass. If you want a bit clearer more balanced sound get the Bose. Pretty happy with my purchase. Posted a video but the sound from the recording does not do it justice.","Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2025",AHXCVP2UMLTJH77NOQMFYNHVFUAA,1,9,Color: Blue Dusk,"April 15, 2025",2025-04-15,2025-04,Bose,Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen) - Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1JCSPYKJL4S70,B0DYB6KMJH,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic and lightweight speaker!,Michael M,5.0,"First off, I just want to say that this speaker is really awesome. For the price, look, style, and sound and everything you're getting this for, it's honestly a great deal. However, I prefer my Bose SoundLink Max in so many ways (and yes, it does cost more than this does so it's not a fair direct comparison).So, this speaker looks so sleek and fantastic, I love the design of it and it's very much a Sony branded product. The idea for being able to hide/remove the clips for the carrying strap for this is great, and it's so cool and innovative with how they designed it.The strap itself is awesome, easily blows away any other strap I've used before both in looks and comfort (it seriously looks cool, I love the lettering and how they colored it all the way across the side of the strap), I love that and it was even included which is great since some speakers (I'm looking at you Bose SoundLink Max) make you pay extra for that.As for the sound, I always prefer a bit more bass to my speakers, so to be honest this one didn't really do It for me compared to my Sonos Move and Bose SoundLink Max which both have significantly better bass, but this had a very balanced sound and could get quite loud without any distortion so I'm still really happy with this.This speaker is also MUCH lighter than the Bose and Sonos speakers I have, like it probably weighs almost half of what either of those weigh, so that's a huge thing this has going for it, it has style and portability while still sounding great.The pairing process is easy to use on this, and the software has gotten a LOT better than it used to be for Sony apps. I stil l prefer the Bose and Sonos apps compared to the Sony one because they're faster, easier to use, and a lot simpler to navigate, but the Sony one is leagues beyond where it used to be in terms of looks and usability.Overall, I have to say, I am really impressed with this speaker and give it a 10/10, definitely recommend. While this definitely won't be my main speaker (that will stay with my Bose SoundLink Max) because I prefer the bass and design of my other speakers, this one is so lightweight and portable and sounds so good for it's size and price, this is pretty much unbeatable at this price point in my opinion, especially since it includes such a sweet looking strap to carry it around places.My recommendation, I would say get this if you want something pretty lightweight and easy to carry around but that sounds good, but if you want some really solid bass and a better overall audio experience and are okay paying a bit more and having a bit of a heavier speaker, maybe look at the Bose SoundLink Max instead, but both are phenomenal options in their price range, and I couldn't be happier with this for what it is.","Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2025",AHWZGTDKJZXJCML57FSNXYBXZICA,0,2,Style: Off White,"April 14, 2025",2025-04-14,2025-04,Sony,Sony ULT Field 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R3LQ3AAPTQXH7L,B0DYB6KMJH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Shockingly Good Sound in a Tough, Travel-Ready Package",Pickles,5.0,"I've had the Sony ULT Field 3 for about a week and a half now, and even though I haven‚Äôt had long stretches of use, I‚Äôve used it pretty much every day‚Äîand it‚Äôs still sitting at 80% battery. That was a surprise in the best way. I have a bunch of Bluetooth speakers (Beats, Bose, Soundcore, JBL‚Ä¶ you name it), but this is my first Sony portable speaker, and honestly, it‚Äôs made a strong first impression.Probably the biggest thing for me is the sound quality. It‚Äôs kind of wild how full and balanced this thing sounds considering its size. The bass is deep and punchy, but it doesn‚Äôt drown out the mids and highs. Everything comes through really clean. I‚Äôve mostly kept it on the ULT sound setting though you can use the Sony app, which has a really intuitive EQ and lets you tweak things if you want. That setting just hits the sweet spot for my ears‚Äîrich bass without muddying everything else.I‚Äôve got it paired to both my iPhone and iPad, and switching between them has been seamless. No connection drops, no delays‚Äîjust smooth transitions. It supports Bluetooth multipoint, so that‚Äôs a big convenience if you tend to bounce between devices like I do.Design-wise, it‚Äôs larger than something like the Beats Pill or Bose SoundLink Flex, but still very portable. It feels incredibly solid‚Äîlike it could take a few accidental drops without breaking a sweat‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not heavy. That balance between durability and portability really works in its favor. Sony throws in a shoulder strap, which is actually really nice quality, but I haven‚Äôt had a use for it yet. If I were headed to the beach or hiking, I‚Äôd probably throw it on, but for around-the-house or backyard use, it‚Äôs not really necessary.Battery life is excellent. Like I mentioned, I‚Äôve barely made a dent in it, and that‚Äôs with near-daily use. The speaker gives you a verbal battery update when you power it on (which you can toggle on/off through the app), and that‚Äôs been super handy. I wish more speakers did that. It‚Äôs also IP67 rated, which means it‚Äôs waterproof, dustproof, and generally built like a tank. I haven‚Äôt tested it in extreme conditions, but knowing it can handle those situations is reassuring.As for downsides? Honestly, not much to complain about. It‚Äôs a bit pricier than some competitors, but to me, the sound quality and build more than justify it. Some people might prefer something smaller or more subtle, but if you want a speaker that really fills a room (or yard), this is worth the extra cash. I also haven‚Äôt felt the need to buy a second one for stereo or party mode, because it already gets more than loud enough for my uses‚Äîbut it‚Äôs tempting.If you're trying to decide between this and something like a JBL Charge or a Bose Flex, this Sony definitely holds its own, especially if sound quality is a priority. It has the clarity and depth that a lot of similarly sized speakers just don‚Äôt quite hit. Another observation on the sound quality: it sounds excellent at high or low volume and does not lose it's depth or clarity in either scenario.In summary:Sound: Excellent‚Äîclear across the board, with rich bassBattery: Long-lasting, smart notifications via the appDesign: Tough but light, easy to carryConnectivity: Reliable, seamless between devicesApp Support: Useful and intuitiveNegatives: Slightly larger than some, a bit pricey‚Äîbut worth itIf you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say go for it. I didn‚Äôt expect to like it this much, but it‚Äôs quickly become my go to speaker.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2025",AGU57KOOWXJPHBCN4OGA2FYGEKJA,0,1,Style: Black,"April 22, 2025",2025-04-22,2025-04,Sony,Sony ULT Field 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Hmmm...,88xpressions,1.0,"No. This is a tin can without the ULT button, kind of like a veil trying not to reveal what it really does without the boost button. It's sounds OK with it on. The eq in the app does little to sway my attention from my JBL charge 6. Handy speaker fits in your hand, as well as being carried with included strap. I own the ULT headphones, and I love those. This speaker doesn't come close to the sound, nor do what my JBL speaker does. The JBL Flip series sounds better than this speaker. Even when they are played at a low volume. When you walk away to another room, you know something is on but you barely hear it. When you return to the desk, you receive full sound. Thats what a good quality speak should do. This speaker is for if you just need a bluetooth speaker to play your music, not concerned about how you want to hear your misic. If you really like spacial audio and decent bass response without all the bells and whistles, save your money.

R3K58ELV5GGS7W,B0BW34LCB8,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great,Edub,5.0,"I already have 2 Era 100's and a Sub mini in my Family room. They sound fantastic. Some times I like to sit in my Living room and read, or meditate. But I would turn the volume up in the family room so I could hear those speakers. So I decided to get a third Era 100 for my living room. I put it on a small decorative shelf. I must say it is everything I imagined it would be. When setting it up I didn't know I could turn off selected speakers. This was a unexpected plus for me. So if I am in my living room I could just have the one Era 100 speaker play and vice versa. Or I could have all three and the sub mini playing at the same time. After having the 2 Era 100's and Sub mini for a couple of months now, I had forgotten how good just 1 Era 100 speaker sound. I did notice the two Era 100's paired with the sub sound more clear and crisp than the single Era 100's. That's because the Sub mini is using the low that the Era 100's would had normally played. Great concept in sound and speakers. I just turned the treble up a little bit more in the single Era 100 to get more highs. Sounds good. It's too bad Sonos doesn't allow for multiple Sub minis connected in the same group, it would be phenomenal. I had read somewhere that it wasn't cost effective for the consumer to buy 2 Sub minis when 1 Gen 3 Sub woofer has more output than two Sub minis. I say who cares Sonos? If a consumer wants to spend their money on a second Sub mini and put in in another room in the same speaker group it's their prerogative. If that's true then their business model doesn't make since to me. Set up was a breeze too. Because I didn't use a tutorial to set this up, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to select the speaker, because at first the single Era 100 didn't play although it was connected. But the setup was a breeze. Very easy. I may get another Era 100 (this time used) and put it in my kitchen and I'll have sound throughout all of downstairs. I've been fortunate to not have problems with the app, unlike many others.

The problem. They never work for streaming music because of a woeful update to its software. Even the NYT, which once recommended the system as the best has changed its mind. About three months ago Sonos updated its system software that literally rendered my entire Sonos speaker system (This Sonos Era 100 included) useless. To use this system as a music streaming device, you must use the Sonos App. Sonos used to have one of the best apps in the business. Intuitive with amazing functionality. A few months ago they tried to update it, basically trying to make it look more like Amazon music. It was an utter failure. Folks like me are wanting to sell their entire system. I stayed with sonos for three months now since they promised they would make things right. They have not. The speakers stop streaming music after playing just one song. Nearly no commands work correctly. When I tell it to stop playing a song. It does not listen. I manually have to press the button on the speaker. This system was developed so you could talk to it and play all music across an entire CD. That used to be possible. Now it is not. Literally stops playing after one song. Via voice prompt, when you tell it to go to the next song, it cannot. We Sonos music streamers have lost the capability to stream music directly from our device's own music library. Many of us bought Sonos because we wanted to have great speakers that would directly play music from our phones or our shared music library folders on our computers. That functionality has ceased to exist. Run! Don't walk. And return these speakers. Their only use today is as a bluetooth device where you have to physically press each song you want to move onto via whatever controlling system you have for bluetooth. The Sonos incompetence here I cannot overstate. A once great company and music system has fallen. Such a shame. It did not have to be this way. If I could speak to the CEO of Sonos I would tell him this: Your bread and butter was your speaker system, not headphones, not other products. Get back to the basics. Restore the streaming functionality that allowed us to enjoy music via touchless voice commands and software that was once top notch. I have five Sonos speakers for sale. I hate to do it, but I am making all my speakers Amazon speakers. At least Amazon respects it customers by doing research before launching new products that destroy the functionality of what used to be. Goodbye, Sonos.

So I gave in and called Sonos Support‚Äîthey were wonderful. I had to download an app on my laptop and download a couple updates. The customer service rep guided me through the process and was just as excited as I was when we got everything working properly.I mention all this first because I know concerns about connectivity/issues with the app might stop a lot of people from buying these. While certainly not as easy as it should be, issues were fixed relatively easily through Sonos support.And my God‚Äîthe sound quality of these speakers are amazing.

RUE030N50F9EJ,B09PYVXXW5,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good with a couple of flaws,CTM,5.0,"I love TWS earbuds. I have many including buds from Sony, Samsung, AKG, Amazon, Soundpeats and more. I was intrigued by small size of the 1More Minis and wanted to try them. For the most part, they are wonderful. They are literally half the size of my other buds with most of the same features. Remarkable. I don't really like large buds hanging out of my ears and really loathe the stemmed variety like Airpods. These minis almost disappear and their extremely light weight makes them very comfortable. The sound is really good, they have very decent ANC and transparency modes, they have in ear detection and an app for some customization. I have no idea how they can manage to squeeze all of these features into such a small bud. On top of the features, the buds last 5 hours with ANC and 6 hours without. Amazing. I would unconditionally recommend these buds except for two annoyances that EVERY YouTube reviewer has complained about. First, limited customization of tap controls. These don't have single tap capability. I understand that to some degree because the buds are so small that it would probably be impossible to reposition them without stopping or starting your music. The bigger problem is 1More's use of Sound ID rather than ""real"" equalizer controls. Sound ID works by offering A/B samples that you select and it creates a profile based on your selections. It's horrible and doesn't work at all for me. I tried it at least 10 times and the Sound ID profile was always worse than the out of the box sound. I have been forced to use third part equalizers on my phone to get them to sound the way I want. 1More, if you want to keep your Sound ID, please add some presets and a manual equalizer the way many others do like Soundcore for example. I dislike Sound ID so much that it prevented me from buying their new EVO buds. I had the buds in my cart and then cancelled the order. The EVO cost more than the mini and I simply didn't want to deal with Sound ID again. If 1More adds equalization and perhaps allows for more tap options, these buds would be fantastic. As it is, I really like them and will workaround the app shortcomings. 1More, if you are listening, I know you can fix these problems.

R385JSD6KWP2QU,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars I wish I could rate 5 stars, but‚Ä¶",Gianna,4.0,"‚Ä¶I just can‚Äôt. Because as useful as these earbuds are, there‚Äôs one huge caveat to them that needs to be made clear.Let‚Äôs start with the positive: the ComfoBuds Mini are incredible for sleeping. While they‚Äôre not advertised as sleep buds, I find it hard to believe that they weren‚Äôt designed with sleep in mind. The flat shape, the small size, the selection of noise-blocking ambient sounds included in the app, even a sleep timer‚Ä¶while you certainly CAN use them as everyday buds (and if you have very small ears, you might want to) these are clearly intended for being comfortable enough to wear at night and block out unwanted noises. I love them for that. I previously hated wearing noise-cancelling earbuds at night, which was somewhat of a necessity to me due to my wife‚Äôs snoring problem; with these buds, I ditched the discomfort and pain and accidental button triggering in favor of a much more comfortable experience, to the point where I actually enjoyed putting them in every night. They‚Äôre not called the ‚ÄúComfoBuds‚Äù for nothing.The ANC is not the best I‚Äôve ever tried, but gets the job done as far as helping to seal out those pesky nighttime disruptions. Sound quality is admittedly not the greatest. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable, it just suffers in a few areas that probably directly relate to the size of the buds. Soundstage is poor, instrument separation is very poor, and the volume tends to skew on the quiet side, but if you‚Äôre using these for sleep, none of that matters too much.Now here comes the real caveat.1MORE is clearly having a serious quality control issue with the ComfoBuds mini. I can‚Äôt say for certain whether this extends to their other models, as this is the only product of theirs I‚Äôve tried. And while the idea is fantastic and they‚Äôve clearly put a lot of effort into the design of these buds, there‚Äôs a persistent issue with one or both earbuds suddenly losing its noise-cancelling ability after a very short period of time, producing whooshing or roaring noises instead of blocking sound.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just earwax blocking up the buds!‚Äù insist the apologist reviewers, as well as 1MORE themselves. ‚ÄúClean them and they‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù But I beg to differ. With my first pair of these, the whooshing started in the right earbud after about two months of use. I immediately followed every bit of advice I could find about cleaning them, to no avail. I thought, okay, that‚Äôs a bummer, and I sent them back and ordered another pair. The left earbud of the second pair started whooshing within two weeks. I repeat: TWO WEEKS. I had used them less than ten times since I got them, plus I was being very careful about cleaning my ears every day, so there is NO WAY that they accumulated enough earwax during that time to block them up. Something else is going on. I wonder if trying to cram so much tech into such a small package is backfiring, and the components are interfering with each other somehow. Maybe that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt normally see ANC in buds of this size.1MORE will replace malfunctioning buds for you, but the process does take a while, and you‚Äôll be without them in the meantime. It seems they‚Äôre aware of the issue, which is good. I really hope that they‚Äôll figure out what‚Äôs wrong and release a second version of the ComfoBuds Mini that doesn‚Äôt have these problems.I should probably take off more than one star for the quality control issue‚Ä¶but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to. Because when these buds are working, they‚Äôre really the perfect sleep buds, and I just can‚Äôt see myself ditching them; nothing blocks out my wife‚Äôs snoring more comfortably than these. I only hope that they‚Äôll continue to improve in the future. In the meantime, it‚Äôs up to you to decide if the risks outweigh the benefits.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHINA7A6O2I5RZSNAY4OWYN4QXVA,1,31,Color: Red,"July 22, 2023",2023-07-22,2023-07,JBL,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini - Wireless Earbuds
R1UB1V4EPP9MN3,B09PYVXXW5,"5.0 out of 5 stars Basically perfect, fantastic wind ANC, perfect case",Colin M.,5.0,"I needed a replacement for my Galaxy buds pro's that have the fatal ANC ""roar in one ear"" that Samsung won't fix, and they don't stay in the ear. Bring an absolutely ENORMOUS fan of the 1more comfobuds z (the single best sleep focused earbuds at any price) I liked that these are also small, the case shape is wonderful (flip top, tiny, wireless charger) and they're relatively inexpensive.The sound quality uses 1more's app to do a ""sounds"" hearing preference test. I would prefer a proper EQ option but it works well enough. I prefer real audiophile iem's and headphones, but enjoyed the Galaxy buds on bass boost, they almost hit like planar magnetics. These are about 80% there. They're totally serviceable, with the only standout being a pretty good technical performance, with genuinely solid imaging and separation. They absolutely do need the soundID set up though, I hate the stock tuning. For tiny little things they are, I am perfectly happy with the sound quality when I want music on my bike or public transit.The ANC is stellar. They have a specific mode for wind reduction that downright curbstomps Samsung and apple. If you ride a bike, you need 1more ANC buds. The transparency mode is great too, very natural sounding. It doesn't have that ""talk and it switches to transparency"" gimmick, but I found it obnoxious on Samsung.Touch controls are easily customized and no ""single touch"" feature means you don't accidentally press anything readjusting or putting them in. Auto pauses when you take one out, your can use just one or the other no problemThe app features depend on the product but these are meant to be usable for sleeping, do they come preloaded with a library of sleep/ambient sounds. I just use my own but it's a nice feature. I can easily fall asleep with them in and I'm a very picky side sleeper, but I do prefer the absolutely microscopic comfobuds z's.The stock eartips did bother me a bit, they have a little ridge from the mold that irritated my ears after a few hours of use. They have a very odd mounting system that I was only able to find one option for, spinfit 1025 tips are shallow enough to fit and still let the case close (the wells for the eartips is a bit to shallow, id like it if they addressed this on a revision) so if you don't like the tips, spinfit 1025's.The case magnets that hold the buds in are hilariously strong. Your have to SMACK it to dislodge them. Very nice detail. The case size is tiny and perfectly shaped to slide into pockets, with a flip top that you can open one handedFor being so small they also stay put well. Not perfect, but I can work out or mow the lawn, an impossible task of the Galaxy buds pro.Overall though, these things rock. They're exactly what I need as a paramedic who also rides a bicycle. 1more is a serious brand with some seriously well thought out products at extremely competitive prices. I can sleep on my side with a podcast and still be able to wake up for a call, they crush wind nose when I'm riding my bike, they sound perfectly adequately tuned with impressive imaging (once you run the sound id feature once) and the case is (slightly too shallow recessions for the eartips aside) very nice in the hand and perfectly shaped.Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2022",AFG2T5XGMQCACK7JBDRHKEKWJLPA,1,21,Color: Red,"August 18, 2022",2022-08-18,2022-08,JBL,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini - Wireless Earbuds
RWYK1GXIVV6H1,B09PYVXXW5,1.0 out of 5 stars Decent but Defective,Aquila,1.0,"UPDATE 6/24/22: As of 6/23/22, my replacement earbuds have the same problem. Sound is reduced then completely lost in the right earbud just a couple of weeks after normal use. Down to 1 star instead of 3 stars. Returning them. Stay within high quality brands like Sony, Bose, and Sennheiser. Replacing them with Sony WFC 500‚Äôs.UPDATE 6/5/22: Amazon replaced my earbuds after some arm twisting. My updated review is underneath the original:After my cheap but mighty pair of Sony wired earphones finally died after years of use, I decided to do some research and finally try earbuds after years of scoffing at the wireless craze. I decided on these due to having small ears. My first pair of comfobuds mini were defective. The right earbud made a ringing noise as soon as I began to use them out of the box. 2 weeks after purchase, the right earbud had no sound. Max sound volume doesn‚Äôt sound very loud unless you have ANC mode turned on. It does not have a proper equalizer. With my defective pair, ANC mode drowned out the melodies even though the bass was good, so the sound wasn‚Äôt very balanced. The touch controls hardly work nor are they very customizable. You sacrifice some features that should be included in this price point for the small size.Review for replacement earbuds:The packaging was different. These came in a black box with a manufacture date of 4/2022. My defective pair was in a white box with a 2/2022 manufacture date. Both pairs of the earbuds were black. The touch controls are more responsive and they work 70% of the time instead of the 20% success rate of my defective pair, but the controls are still very limited for the price point. These definitely are as loud as they should be at max volume. Bass is good and the sound is more balanced. The bass in the defective pair was definitely stronger, but it overpowered and drowned out the melodies, making the sound unbalanced and less dynamic. I‚Äôm not sure if this has to do with the pair itself or the firmware. I have been on firmware version 0.10.38 for both pairs and have not yet updated, so it may be the pair itself. Eartips are comfortable but they may be problematic as they don‚Äôt create enough of a buffer between your ear and the mesh, so your mesh may get waxy which may impact the sound. Keep them and your ears clean and I recommend buying better aftermarket eartips. Since this is my first pair of wireless earbuds ever, I really can‚Äôt accurately measure how good the ANC is as I have nothing to compare it to yet. I ride trains frequently and I never hear my surroundings when ANC is turned on. The battery life seems low at a 4 hour play time with ANC enabled, but the charging case replenishes life fairly quickly. 1more customer service was fine and replied to me quickly, but I ended up getting the replacement faster through Amazon customer service. Overall I‚Äôll bump the earbuds up to a 3 out of 5 stars. They lose points for the lack of touch controls, lack of a real equalizer, and being overpriced. The sound is decent, the size is great, and they are light-weight and comfortable. While I still prefer the sound quality of wired earphones, I‚Äôll keep these in my collection if they don‚Äôt fizzle out on me too fast again.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2022",AGFUWY2GO4HF5RMLUR7ZOSKID4KA,1,9,Color: Black,"June 3, 2022",2022-06-03,2022-06,JBL,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini - Wireless Earbuds

Now on to the bad.ANC.. was alright then I started noticing the left bud wouldn‚Äôt function like the right one. A day later whenever anc was enabled the left bud would vibrate and distort sound. Tried resetting and all of that but it‚Äôs clearly a hardware issue as it now happens whenever I try to use them. These buds also lack a mono sound when only one is in use. I own many buds and I‚Äôve never run into that before so when using one bud you‚Äôre missing out on a lot of tucked away frequencies. When anc was functioning properly it was eh at best. To me more sound was canceled out with all functions turned off. I‚Äôve literally only had these for 3 days and they‚Äôre defective already which is a shame because I like the sound and how they fit. Transparency mode was a little much for me especially considering you can‚Äôt adjust the volume for it.Touch controls are hardly customizable, I‚Äôm not a fan of only having two tap and triple tap functions.Call quality was actually pretty bad.

RKZ7RXOAQCUT9,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, comfortable headphones",Victoria,4.0,"I'm very impressed with these little earbuds. I bought them because I have noisy upstairs neighbors and needed some noise cancelling headphones to help me sleep. I'm a side sleeper, and while these aren't totally perfect for that, they're comfortable enough that I don't have trouble falling asleep. It helps if you use a very squishy pillow (my memory foam pillow is too firm and makes them dig into my ears). They're very comfortable for regular daily use too. I have an oddly shaped ear canal that makes earbuds constantly fall out of my left ear, but these are small enough that they fit snugly.I'm no audiophile, but the sound is good. Can't complain. They don't sound as good as my Bose headphones that I normally wear, but they're like 1/50 of the size so I can't really fault them for that. I wish the app let you adjust the sound settings manually. As far as I can tell, you can only adjust them by taking their sound preference quiz. The touch controls are a little annoying. The tutorial said you double tap to play/pause, but I've never gotten that to work. They do sometimes randomly pause when I remove or adjust them, though.The noise cancelling works really well. I was kind of blown away by it, since I've never had earbuds with ANC capabilities before. I can't hear the thumping from my neighbors' music at ALL. Way better than I was expecting. It also blocks out the sound of my fan completely. I can definitely still hear sudden, abrupt noises, but it's very muffled. The ""transparent"" setting is also nice, since I like to be able to hear my surroundings when I'm out walking.These aren't marketed as sleep headphones, and I suspect that is partly because of the battery life. They last around 4 hours with ANC enabled, so they won't last you a full night's sleep. Not a huge deal for me since my neighbors usually cool it with the music at around 4am, but it wouldn't be ideal if you were trying to block out a snoring partner, loud AC unit, etc. For the price I didn't really expect much more than that, but it's significantly less than all of the other wireless earbuds I've owned.

I own my own IT/technology company and I am truly passionate about technology. Simply put these are the best fitting perfect size earbuds on the market. There are no competitors who make earbuds that aren't giant or hang out of medium to small ears. By combining all metrics that earbuds are judged by today the Comfo Buds minis are in a league of their own. The sound quality iis good, noise canceling decent and has the basic features (transparency, basic touch controls) that we have come expect. With that said it's impossible to provide a negative review of these earbuds without attempting to nitpick, are doing a deep comparison in the technical specifics that ultimately most users don't understand. There are very few things in the technology space that are the best at every facet of their market. If you are someone who has smaller ears or just thinks the average size of earbuds is ridiculous than these earbuds are perfect. No they're not top sound quality top noise canceling, top battery life. They are good everywhere.

These issues can occur in one side only, or both sides.All you have to do is clean the metal mesh, it's become clogged with your earwax. Trust me, I guarantee that is what the problem is. You have to unclog all the little holes, I used a bristle from a brush which was thin enough to fit. The holes are very tiny.You might start to have volume issues with an earbud not being as loud as the other. It's the holes getting clogged. Once they're all clogged up, you won't be able to hear anything except a very quiet, constant, white noise.The screeching noise occurs when trying to use active noise canceling, while the metal screen is clogged. Don't ask me why, I'm not an expert, but for some reason that's what happens when the mesh is plugged up and you switch to ANC mode. The problem will be completely fixed once you clear out all those tiny holes.Tons of people report these issues occurring after about a month of use, and exchanging them only to run into similar issues with the new pair. It's not the earbuds, it's you. You've got gunk in your ears. You can prevent running into these problems by making sure your ears are clean before using them, cleaning off any earwax after you take them out and before putting them back in the case, and making sure the part of the case where the buds go is clean as well.

I hope they improve enough in the future that I can invest in them again without these issues.Bluetooth 5.2: Great connection and distance, but in order to connect to different devices you have to go into the device your connected to and disconnect before the other device can connect. My older Bluetooth headphones can release the connection when the new device wants to connect without having to go into the settings like that.

I really hope they update these and fix whatever the issue is since I've seen other people talk about this, and these were literally the best headphones for the very few uses I got.

The noise cancellation function is nice but not perfect; it's enough for most use cases but if you want complete and total silence, I might look elsewhere.The app is easy to use and convenient, the tap response is very smooth and useful, and the connection is very strong. I'm getting about 5 hours of use per charge, which is nothing to scoff at. The charging case is fairly small. I'm getting a Qi charging pad today so I'll update this review to let you all know whether it's compatible or not.My only complaint is a minor one: the silicon tips that come with these are trash. The driver and tip came apart almost immediately, and for the life of me I can't get them to fit comfortably or stay together. I got some new foam tips which are far better, but the case needs the earbuds to fit very snugly so they won't charge with other tips on.

It has impressive sound from such a small package, can get loud enough to drown out background noise with anc on.The two things that prevent this from being perfect are:One, there is no touch controls that I have found to allow you to control the volume. This is a big deal as I use ear buds to listen to tv at night and I'm unable to use these as the volume is always maxed out with no way to lower..Two, you have to use the case to pair to different devices. This makes it difficult to swap connections, I typically switch between a computer, phone, and tv throughout my normal day. With other earbuds I'm able to put them into pairing mode and easily connect to whatever device I'm using without taking them out or using the case.If they could fix these two issues, these would be the only buds I would use, but I do have to switch to one ov my other sets for tv watching do to the volume control.","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2023",AGWODMFAPF4W6NOBG6LMLCW2XCAA,1,5,Color: Black,"March 18, 2023",2023-03-18,2023-03,JBL,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini - Wireless Earbuds

I can wear a bandana over my ears and no one can't tell I have earbuds as they don't stick out at all. Others claim they're small but they still stick out. I would say everything else is poor and my biggest complain is the lack of quality control. I started getting problems with the earbuds cutting off and sometimes they will get out of sync, which putting them back and pressing the case button three times seemed to fix it it was super annoyning...imagine having soapy hands or just busy and can't take them off right away while you got a mess of sound in your ears, it has lattency when you watch videos too. None of this ever happened with my jaybird vista for the 3 years I had them.Also I noticed that the left earbud led light was not aligned with the orifice like it should, so definetely a quality control issue. When I reset the earbuds the lights on the earbuds flicker but at different rates which lets me to believe something isn't right. Again the left one is flickering randomly faster than the right one. I watched do this for a while and could not identify the pattern...almost as they would somehow try to sync and stop and start over endlessly with no success.

There are fewer options for touch control, the sound quality and the ANC is not close to being as good as the Pro buds. They are more comfortable and the touch pad is more responsive, however. I have had difficulty getting the Minis to connect with my MacBook air while the Pros connect perfectly. Both connect with my iPhone 12 effortlessly, just not at the same time.

Eventually I had only one earbud that worked and it would barely emit any sound. I reached out to their customer service and they were able to send me a new one, but only after I jumped through a bunch of hoops and paid $12 to send them the broken one with trackable shipping with UPS since they needed a tracking #.The second set worked well about a month until the same thing happened with one of the earbuds getting quieter. Then one morning before work I plugged them in for about 15 minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I left them any longer, because when I grabbed the case, it was so hot that I burned my fingers (even left a mark for a few days).

Previous 1More earbuds I have purchased in the past were superbly packaged with great documentation. That was not the case 1More Comfobuds. The sound produced by the earbuds is good, not great. True to their name, they are very lightweight, a plus. But the documentation for this product is unacceptable in terms of the limited amount of information and the absurdly small type in the users manual. The documentation states that the earbuds come with replacement buds of a larger and smaller size, but there were none in my package. Nor is there an app associated with this device which allows you to adjust controls. So between the unreadable manual and the absence of an app, I had absolutely no idea how to adjust. For example, I had no idea how to activate or regulate the noise cancellation feature. I replaced these earbuds with 2nd Gen iPod Pros, at twice the price, but more than twice the value in comparison to the 1More Comfobuds.

Unless you're used to professional grade sound equipment, these will cover most anyone's sound needs.SMALL EAR HAVERS! I have been on a quest to find comfy earbuds. So far, these have come the closest. I can wear them for like 2 hours with minimal discomfort. This is a huge upgrade from ""most cause physical pain near immediately"". When placed correctly, they're pretty solid. I couldn't shake them out. They did come loose a handful of times and needed to be readjusted, but in comparison to the others needing that every 5 minutes? I'll take it.They say they have ANC, but honestly, I'm not so sure. In my personal experience, turning ANC on didn't actually cancel any noise. It just brought the bass out. Unless I just can't get the right fit, the ANC mode is effectively just a ""make the music sound better"" button.The drawback here is that you can only use ANC if both buds are in. Not usually a problem, unless you want to pop one in to listen to music and leave the other ear open for communication.

From a technical perspective battery life, sound quality, and reliability were my major issues. I knew the batteries lasted less than 8 hours with anc on but personally think 8 hours needs to be the target to get you through long haul flights. Then comes the audio quality which is good but not great they do have an app to adjust the equalizer, though not directly, and it did make it sound better to my ears but still fell a bit flat. The final issue that I have gone through 2 pair in less than a month. It starts off as a low hum/click in the left ear bud when anc or passthrough are active that gets worse over time. It is low and might be missed by many but if you go through the reviews you will find others reporting the same issue. It appears many people either don‚Äôt have this problem or it doesn‚Äôt bother them so you might get lucky but at the MSRP it wouldn‚Äôt be worth the risk for me.On the positive side these buds are the smallest I have ever tried and I love them for that.m. Other than the slight ear pressure I have forgotten they are in. I also have found the ANC is reasonable but don‚Äôt perform anywhere close the Sony xm2 headphones.

I was excited to get them since they were smaller than most and I was hoping they'd fit in my ears since most wireless earbuds I've tried in the past don't.I was enjoying the earbuds and thus was very disappointed when after a month of use the left earbud all of a sudden started playing at a lower volume than the right earbud. I confirmed this by putting the earbuds in the opposite ears to confim the issue wasn't with me and also tested wired earbuds to check the phone audio. I assumed that I must have gotten a bad pair of earbuds and returned them and got a replacement pair.Well now after a month of use again the replacement pair is exhibiting the same exact issue! The sound difference is even greater than before. I have no idea why this same exact issue happened and why both happened after just about a month of normal use.I'm assuming this issue can't be happening to all pairs of these earbuds otherwise I'd expect there to be considerably more negative reviews.

I can reduce the volume to an acceptable 5% - they don't reduce in volume as well as my airpods that can get just a bit lower before muting, but better than any other. I wish they have the timer function that the comfoBuds Z have. The ANC is good. The Transparent listening modes is weird - some ambient noise in my home, like the refrigerator, gets louder.

Lastly the transparency mode is just ok. You can hear things going on around you but its not perfect by far. The connection during phones calls has mixed reviews in my opinion.

As compared to Samsung galaxy pro, the sound quality is significantly less as is the range and battery life. As I wanted them primarily for sleeping I would have been ok with all the less adequate features IF they had continued to work. After about two months the left earphone volume started declining. After another month the volume was so low as to make the left earbud worthless. Interestingly both earbuds will decline in volume as the battery gets lower. This is annoying as you wake up not hearing whatever it is you were listening to. Overall they aren‚Äôt great but would serve for the primary purpose of sleeping in if the company can figure out the volume issues.

R11OSJ184YK5L8,B09FM6PDHP,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality,Amazon Customer,5.0,"This review is representative of my first impressions after receiving the item.Fit - 4/5: While I've had better fitting earbuds in the past, I would say that these aren't problematic at all, but not perfect either. The buds fit fairly snugly in my ears, and its quite nice that they've included a few tips. They don't seem to move around if I shake my head, so I have decent confidence that if I take them to the gym or on a run, I wouldn't have problems. That said, they don't quite fit perfectly, but everyones ear is a bit different so others might find it better or worse.Sound - 5/5: All I can say is wow do I love the sound that these produce. The level of bass is far beyond anything that I've had from my other earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t and Jlabs JBuds Air). The app includes equalizer settings that actually make quite a lot of difference (unlike other headphone apps I have used) and I am blown away by how much bass can come from these headphones. I have also noticed with other wireless buds that they tend to be on the quiet side, not reaching the same volume that my larger Sony headphones can, but that is not at all the case here. These get LOUD. As someone who plans to mainly use these for workouts, this is exactly what I hoped for.Battery - 5/5: So far I have not had a chance to use these until they die, so I have to disclaim that. However, if the battery matches up or comes close to their claims, which I expect they will given it is a reputable brand, then I will be impressed. My other buds max out at around 8 hours, so getting almost 4x the total battery life is excellent. 8 hours without recharging is very impressive.Look and feel - 3/5: The case looks nice and I think the aesthetics are fine. But the buds themselves are polished smooth, which makes them a bit tricky to handle with your fingertips. Once they're in, its no problem. But a matte finish or some texture would have been better for usability.I'll update this review if I find any reason to, but I am extremely impressed by the headphones, especially for the price point.

So they get an A plus for adjustability in that regard.I love the color, I chose navy but there many to choose from. I haven‚Äôt used them much for phone calls yet, but they pick up the wind a lot so I‚Äôve chosen not to use them for most of my phone calls when I‚Äôve had them in.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AHKSTPYCQ256XNBIJJNN5IKNF43A,1,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,"July 29, 2024",2024-07-29,2024-07,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

Again very happy with the quality but more importantly for me is the battery life, these are very comparable with the higher end jlab buds that will last me the entire work day and have enough juice in the case so that I'm not having to charge them multiple times a week. These are amazing in both categories. And lastly you can listen to each bud independently which is a must for people like me that usually only wear one. So In the off chance one dies you just pop in the other one and your good to go for another 8 hours.","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2024",AGYXE4BIFF7ICA2CNQ27K5VYPBCQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"July 25, 2024",2024-07-25,2024-07,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R1PDE5V244R06D,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars At 50% or more off, these are great.",Dru Ha,5.0,"I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldn‚Äôt have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they‚Äôre a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds. Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3‚Äôs. I‚Äôm an audiophile on a budget. They can‚Äôt compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they‚Äôre a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I‚Äôve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that‚Äôs due to the EQ setting I‚Äôve selected. You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven‚Äôt found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the ‚Äúambient-aware‚Äù or ‚Äútalk through‚Äù modes. That‚Äôs a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don‚Äôt seem to have any functional ANC. I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They‚Äôll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1. However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc. it‚Äôs a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don‚Äôt want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AFUR62MXQUALQJX5LDFW3KOQBQLA,1,99,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,"November 11, 2023",2023-11-11,2023-11,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

R3U67WG7KC37BZ,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, these are good sounding earbuds",Mike,5.0,"There are review sites around that test headphones and earbuds and as far accuracy in frequency response and imaging, these earbuds outrank most other brand's more expensive earbuds.I have the JBL Tune 600BTNC headphones which are a great over the ear headphones and these earbuds sound just as good and even a bit clearer. That's hard to do. Both, these 230NC and the 600BTNC have bass between 20Hz and 100Hz elevated by 3db to 5db, the 230NC being a bit more accurate. That's Ok because I like my bass a few decibels higher.These earbuds have really good punch as well as ultra low bass down to 20HZ. Comparing these 230NC to your subwoofer is a great way to see how good or weak your subwoofer is. Since these 230NC earbuds are accurate from 20Hz to 60Hz within 1db or +4db above 100Hz, most subwoofers can't provide the bass these earbuds can.The clarity in the midrange and treble is great, and without elevation to make music sound bright and fatiguing.I have tried the JBL Club Pro Plus and Tune 125TWS and neither would seal correctly or be comfortable to wear more than 10 minutes. Mainly because of the big club at the end of the actual ear piece. Those earbuds don't fit good in every ear because they are big. The 230NC doesn't have club at the end of the earpiece but a small thin stalk like most ""wired"" earbuds that fit everyone good. These 230NC with their long thin stalks fit my ears good and seal good, plus they are actually more comfortable than my 600BTNC headphones. The Club Pro Plus actually hurt my ears and left them in pain for an hour after only wearing them for 10 minutes.These 230NC earbuds sound great, seal good, and are comfortable enough to wear for hours. I don't see doing any better than some $300 earbuds or headphone for sound quality.The one thing they fall down in and so do my 600BTNC is that they use the lower class active noise cancelling instead of the adaptive noise canceling. Honestly they sound great even in a noisy plant with the active noise cancelling.For the price slashing Amazon does to the retail price, they are a bargain IMO.The only thing I wish they had was function to test if they are sealed correctly like the Club Pro Plus had in it's app. That way you know you are getting the maximum bass response that these earbuds can produce. I simply test using music with ultra low bass that I'm very familiar with.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2023",AF7UFK3GWNSBHUXMPCXJM5LZIKJA,1,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"February 7, 2023",2023-02-07,2023-02,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R21G2QA3DWXAWV,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars A satisfactory pair of earbuds with a decent attempt at noise cancellation,Tonigiri,4.0,"In this review, I will compare the jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds with some of the best wireless earbuds of 2023, based on four criteria: noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, and design.Noise cancellation: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have active noise cancellation, which works well in most situations, but may not be effective in very loud environments. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with outstanding noise-canceling performance that adapts to your surroundings and personal preferences. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also excellent, with adjustable noise cancellation levels and a transparency mode. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is another good option, with effective noise cancellation and spatial audio support.Sound quality: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds deliver a decent sound quality, with a balanced and clear output. However, they may not satisfy audiophiles who prefer a more detailed and dynamic sound. The Technics EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds are the best in this category in my opinion, with a superb sound quality that rivals some of the best over-ear headphones. They have a rich and balanced sound signature, with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. They also support high-resolution audio codecs and have a dedicated app for EQ customization. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are also great, with a dynamic and engaging sound that can be tweaked via the Sony Headphones Connect app. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also impressive, with a top-notch sound quality that is well-balanced and natural. Keep in mind that the jbl 230 nc sits in a very different price point than the earbuds above so it's still punching way above its weight in this regard.Battery life: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a battery life of about four hours, which is average for wireless earbuds. They come with a charging case that can provide an additional 12 hours of playback. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with a battery life of up to eight hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. They also have a quick charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just 10 minutes of charging. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 are also good, with a battery life of up to six hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 30 hours with the charging case. They also support wireless charging and have a fast charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just five minutes of charging.Design: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a simple and sleek design, with a matte black finish and a jbl logo on each earbud. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear, with three sizes of silicone ear tips to choose from. They are also water-resistant, which means they can withstand sweat and rain. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is the best in this category, with a sleek and ergonomic design that fits snugly in your ears. They have an open design without tips, which means they don't block out the outside sound completely. They also have force sensors on each stem that let you control music playback, calls, noise cancellation, and voice assistants. The Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds are also stylish and comfortable, with a winged design that keeps them secure in your ears. They have an IPX4 rating for water resistance and have touch controls on each earbud.Conclusion: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds are a decent pair of headphones for casual listeners who want to escape the noise of the world. However, they are not the best in any category, and they face stiff competition from other models that offer better performance and features. If you want the best noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, or design, you may want to consider other options such as the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Technics EAH-AZ80, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2, or the Apple AirPods Pro 2. At this price point however, which is often lower (I bought mine on sale for 50% off), the jbl 230 nc is a no-brainer and will give you a value you can't say no to.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AEFYG6AEEKPWIUMDM2IYUSDK2FLA,1,140,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphones,"August 15, 2023",2023-08-15,2023-08,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R1PQYT04HC2P7L,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had high hopes, jury is still out.",Shonna,4.0,"I bought these to replace my skullcandy sesh Evo. I had the skillcandy for over a year & recently I lost the left bud & then the right ear bud decided it was gonna be finicky about charging. Like the sensor wasn't connecting properly anymore. It was getting super frustrating because I only had 1 ear bud left & when I wanted to use it it would either be dead or only give me a few minutes. After watching many reviews on YouTube & reading them here I decided I'd get these JBL ones as they had good reviews & *bonus* they were on sale for $49.00. I am on day 3 of using them. Around my house I normally only wear 1 ear bud so I can still keep an ear on my kids. I used the right ear bud all day yesterday, sticking it back in the case when not in use. Last night I went to use the left ear bud & it didn't automatically connect when I took it out like the right one. When I had both out it connected so I put the right back in the case. When I woke up this morning I went to use the left one & the app said it only had 20% battery even though it was in the charger all night. In messing with them I realized even in the case the left was still connected & playing. I finally got it to connect to the charger & work properly. But I feel like it shouldn't be this difficult. It's not rocket science placing the ear buds in the case. I am using these for music, podcasts, & watching shows. The sound is great. I haven't made calls with them. They fit comfortably in my ear, I like the black sleek color. I am just hoping I don't continue to have charging or connection issues as I will use these EVERY SINGLE DAY all throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AEB4PHJN3LWFAU3TMAW2QU6XRTIQ,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"July 18, 2024",2024-07-18,2024-07,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

The noise canceling I'll tell you how good it is: I ride public transportation a d our roads in the city is not good so it makes the bus rattle when it goes over the bumps and it canceled that loud noise out to about 20-30% of the original sound.

I wanted to replace a former set of earbuds with something more substantial and higher quality. I really love all that JBL does (I have purchased their FLIP bluetooth speaker as well and it's fantastic).However, for some reason, everything just crashed and burned suddenly. First, the left earbud stopped charging altogether (no light shows up even after cleaning the contacts). Then the charging case went entirely dead after just charging it to 100%. So I'm figuring it's the end. Sadly.I had figured a mid-priced brand would be a nice middle ground (somewhere between Tribit and Bose lol). I am not a power user and am very careful with my earbuds, so maybe this was just as long as these were going to live.

This is the first time I've ever purchased Bluetooth wireless ear buds - so, know going forwards that I don't have anything to compare these to.That being said, I do have a few pairs of Bluetooth wireless headphones, and I'm making some assumptions, based upon these.So, the first thing I'll say is that the Noise Canceling feature in these is downright amazing. I mean, for something so small to be able to block out so much noise is just quite unbelievable.In addition, the Ambient Aware mode is quite amazing as well, as you can literally hear everything around you, while still hearing the music quite clearly - you can tell that a lot of R & D went into these.The Talk Through mode is also good - although I think it makes the music so low that you really can't even hear it - but it is handy in case you need to have a conversation. I've had a conversation with Ambient Aware mode turned on, and I can hear the other person just fine.Okay, here is where I'll start making some assumptions. I don't have another pair of BT earbuds to compare to, so I'm assuming that other companies would create apps similar to the ones for their BT headphones when making apps for their ear buds.The JBL app is my favorite one. It's very easy to get into, has some settings you can change (like what each ear bud does when you touch it certain ways), as well as allows you to change the audio mode that you've enabled.Now, I have a pair of Anker BT headphones, and they are really comfy, but the app is nowhere near as feature-rich as the JBL app is.I guess if there is anything that I don't like about these it would be the inability to turn them off without using the app. You can set them to time out after a set amount of time, so they would turn themselves off at some point, but I think that is a waste of the battery, so I use the app to turn them off.Another thing I don't like is the case - the ear buds fit into it in a very awkward way - I'm always having to twist my wrists to get them in correctly. I think this was a major design flaw, but it's minor compared to all the other benefits of these.One thing I absolutely love on these is the battery. I've used these for about an hour, turned them off (via the app), kept them outside of the case, and come back to them a month later, and they are still at the same battery percentage as a month ago - unbelievable.I should also mention that the battery lasts a fair amount of time when actually listening to them. I use these when working out, and they last plenty of time for me to run and lift weights.I've never actually tried to figure out exactly how long they last on one charge, but if I'd have to guess, it's probably upwards of 5 hrs at least.To save battery power, I usually put mine in a ziplock bag, along with the case - so that the battery gets to run-down without being recharged all the time. I only put them back into the case when the battery is actually low.The case also charges very quickly (as do the ear buds as well).So, overall, I'd highly recommend these ear buds. They have some minor issues that I've discussed, but in my opinion, the pro's far outweigh the con's for these.If you found this review helpful, please click on ""helpful"" or the thumb's up.Thanks.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AEVRSFNYMIZ3OQFLXTDUEWLZW7YA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"January 3, 2023",2023-01-03,2023-01,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

R1410OSM6X1DP8,B09FM6PDHP,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not good for motorcycle use, but excellent sound quality.",Jeffrey Jenkins,3.0,"I bought these in an attempt to improve upon the mediocre sound quality of the ""MiPeace"" earbuds I've been using on my motorcycle for about a year now, and in that respect the JBL did not disappoint - these really are quite good sounding (almost as good as my old Etymotic ER-6 wired earbuds). Sitting on my bike with the engine running but not moving the active noise cancellation seemed to work very well - I couldn't hear the engine at all, actually - but once I started moving things weren't quite so rosy. It seems the active noise cancellation is just a tad too slow to respond to wind buffeting noise because the music is horribly distorted as if one is listening to speakers through the spinning blades of a fan. Unfortunately, with the active noise cancellation turned off the silicone cup style earplugs don't do near as good a job of passively blocking ambient sounds as the silicone triple-rib style earplugs on the MiPeace (or the Elgin's I replaced these with), so I reluctantly returned them.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFULIFC3V2ECRHMU7GIFX6PYSOHQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"July 29, 2024",2024-07-29,2024-07,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

(So you can optionally listen to people speak while cutting out a few decibles like fan noise.)- Build quality is solid!- The JBL app works flawlessly!- They connect to phone and other devices easily, total plug & play!Cons:- They tend to disconnect more often, which isn‚Äôt that annoying per se ‚Äî except it makes a beep sound to alert you that something is wrong. (The Apple earbuds just turn off, so there‚Äôs no jarring loud beep in your ears.) This is especially annoying when it happens in the middle of a song.- This one is weird ‚Äî If you hold the two earbuds in your hand, and they touch in a certain way, it makes a loud chirping noise. (Almost like the feedback of two microphones being too close together.)- They‚Äôre kind of bulky, and fall out of my ears more often than the Apple AirPods did. Even after changing the rubber tips. (The bright side is that because they‚Äôre so bulky, they‚Äôre easier to find on the ground.)- Though you can use the JBL app to find your earbuds, it doesn‚Äôt help you find the charging chase.Conclusion:- For $50, I‚Äôll keep ‚Äòem! The sound quality is truly excellent enough to look past the weird quirks.And if they get lost, as most earbuds often do, it won‚Äôt break my wallet to do so. (The Apple ones are comfy and have less quirks, but kind of overrated at that price point.)So I would buy JBL earbuds again ‚Äî though I might look into the smaller models, that maybe (hopefully) aren‚Äôt as prone to pop out of the ear like a cartoon bean.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AFZYWTX4DWEYTGWMVJVRWCJBXPIA,1,50,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,"December 5, 2023",2023-12-05,2023-12,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

R1IG9HV4RNJRWA,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Ken,3.0,"There are several things I like about the JBL 230. The sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancelling is excellent for this price range. So, if you're in a noisy office or work environment, these may work for you. The battery life is great, and the JBL app provides a good equalizer for customizing your sound. I love the blue color, and the touch controls work, even if finding that ""sweet"" spot takes a bit of practice.What I don't like is that every time you put the earbuds in, they start in the ""Ambient Aware"" mode (sounds around you are amplified). It's great, if you want to hear what Margret down in accounting thinks about Bob's new haircut from across the room, but I hate it. I'm typically putting in earbuds to block out the sound around me, not to make it louder. Plus, the Ambient Aware function uses battery life. I'd much rather have the ability to start in a ""normal"" (non-amplified) setting, but that's not available. You have to start with them active and either open up the app to turn it off or set the buds to use a touch feature to turn it off (meaning you can't use the touch feature to control your music, change volume or anything else).My second gripe is around the microphones and wind. Any slight breeze makes it impossible for you to be heard at the other end of a phone call. I'm often outside and I simply can't make phone calls if there's a breeze. Likewise, driving with the windows down while on the phone is a no-go. The wind drowns out everything else. If you happen to have Ambient Aware turned on (remember, it's the default?), it amplifies that wind noise in your ears, as well, even if you're not on the phone. This is a real deal breaker, and everyone from Apple to Samsung and Sony do a much better job of limiting wind noise on phone calls with their buds.There are other minor things. The buds are very lightweight, which is good, but they stick a little too far out of my ear, so they're always getting knocked loose. They sit in the case with the speakers facing outward, so you always have to turn them around when taking them out or putting them away, since most people are designed with their ear canals going *in* to their heads (this design makes zero sense). The app is slow to load. You can't do anything in the app until it finds and connects to your buds, so you have to have at least one bud in to use the app for anything, which is weird (I can't even view the app right now to tell you about it because my buds are at home, so the app won't open), and many app features aren't accessible unless you have both buds in.I really wanted to like these, but the inability to use them in 90% of the cases I want them just makes them worthless to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AFKKJU65DENPLES5WGHT46LVPJJA,1,129,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,"June 7, 2023",2023-06-07,2023-06,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

Countless times i've jumped because my husband is behind me and I didn't hear him... when its just in my ears they are also very quieting. But you hear a small amount of pass through... The clarity is amazing, the fit is perfection. I do not like that it has a harder time connecting bluetooth to two different devices where my airpods i could easily switch between the two. I also don't like the fact if they aren't 'on' in the app you can't search for them. If my airpod goes mia at least i can search for it all the time until its fully dead not just shut off.... that would be lovely if they could improve a few of these because they'd be far more superior than any other headphone system on the market.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AER36HXTR3UI4IHSVQG2UO7PZ5NQ,1,9,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphones,"May 24, 2024",2024-05-24,2024-05,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

This case is so slippery. I am someone very mindful of my electronics and have never so much as cracked a phone screen, but I can't even count how many times this case has just slipped out of my hands or off of a surface. The charging lights on the case have began to malfunction. I like these earbuds, but I would recommend storing the case in a pouch or something with a little more grip to it.As for the earbuds themselves, they're great. I've had them for a year now and they work wonderfully. The audio quality is great, not the best but worth the price. They fit into my ears wonderfully and don't slip out easily which is quite rare for me. The Bluetooth range also seems to be quite large and I never have issues with that.One other thing is that the battery has definitely dwindled rapidly in the past year, but I use these earbuds everyday for at least a few hours, so that's to be expected. I don't mind charging them more often. The earbuds themselves still last about five to seven hours on a full charge, which is absolutely perfect for me.I like these earbuds a lot.

R3CQL0C7IB5R18,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Ambient Aware white noise,Adam,3.0,"Edit: Dropping original 5/5 for both earbuds to 3.5/5. Connectivity problems occasionally. I had the microphone just straight up gave up in the middle of a call and had to restart my computer to get it back to work again, unpair and pair didn't work. Occasionally, they randomly disconnect for a second or so, like every couple of hours on average. When that happens, there's a chance for one ear bud to be slightly delayed than the other, and has to unpair and pair to fix.If you use both earbuds all the time, then it's great for $50-60. 5/5Comfortably fit in my ears and don't fall out much when jogging. They'll still fall out when the moving is too much, but that's unavoidable in any earbuds like this. ANC works wonders. The sound quality is good for the price. Microphone is hit and miss like every other earbud out there, but generally works well.If you ever use just the right earbud, then it's awful. 0/5The ambient aware gives out a very audible white noise all the time. And it will automatically be turned on if you only use the right earbud. You cannot turn it off because the ambient aware setting is on the left earbud only. You can only turn that off in the phone app. But if the earbud is not connected to the phone, then you can't change it.One work around is to go to the phone app and let both earbud to have the ambient aware on off functions, but you will lose the right earbud's play/pause function. And you need to turn it off every single time you use it.The connection chime and setting change chimes are extremely loud and I can't find a way to lower the volume. So that's further annoyance. This applies to both single and both earbuds modes.I personally hate these and will be returning the earbuds.

That would be a pair of L26 speakers, I purchased on lay-a-way, when I was 16, back in 1976 for $875. That would be over $6000 in 2023 dollars. Later I purchased JBL's J2050 Book-Shelf speakers and later still JBL's Media 100 Desk-Top speakers.

I submitted a fairly detailed explanation, sufficient for their support staff to realize I was already paired to my phone. So I learned that ear-buds come in single-pairing and multi-point-pairing. The JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds are single-pairing, which is just fine for me. These ear-buds can be very immersive, watching TV or Listening to music. The noise cancellation does a nice job of muffling surrounding noise. I had taken them with me on walks to listen to music or books-recordings and I became a bit concerned at how much of the sound around me was deadened. You then have to keep your head on a swivel.As these are my first ear-buds, I don't know if this is common but while out for a walk, the microphone ports, built into the ear-buds, pick up and transmit the sound of the wind scouring the microphone ports.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGJRRXVA43IHAW4WHREBWAXE2GYQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,"February 26, 2024",2024-02-26,2024-02,JBL,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

They are also an amazing price for such high quality, well-fitting earbuds.

R3UK6JSSN2LFZ2,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good inexpensive earbuds.,nekoBasu,4.0,"I recommend these as an inexpensive earbud set.I like that they're red, so that stand out on my messy desk.I needed a new set to of earbuds, and decided Apple wasn't getting any more of my money in this space. I'm not thrilled with the longevity or support apple provides for their airpods pro.I found these on a list of of good cheap earbuds, and I'm happy. They work fine at the gym. out of the box, with the default rubber ear tips, I ran a mile on the treadmill this morning and I didn't fiddle with these once (for fit). They stay right where they're supposed to, which is not something I can say for airpods pro or another pair of earbuds I'd been using at the gym.These are not audiophile grade headphones. if you want that, keep looking. They do isolate pretty well. The base on the bass boost eq setting is just ok. But the sound is balance enough that it's not overly ""tinny"". I hate cheap speakers, and these don't sound too cheap. So while it's not the finest sound ever, it's still far from junk.Technically, coming from airpods, there are two downsides I've noticed (both survivable).1 - with my fingers - the buds themselves are very hard to remove from the charging case. If I never had owned airpods, I'm not sure I would know this. on the other hand, I think they seat really nicely in the case, and thus they always charge. The airpods famously don't always connect inside their case and sometimes aren't charging when you think they are. I'm ok with it, and I assume I'll eventually learn the ""trick"" to pulling these guys out with ease.2 - these were very easy to pair to my iphone. HOWEVER, unlike airpods, once these are paired to a device, they CANNOT be paired to another device unless they bluetooth connection is disconnected from the first device. e.g. with airpods, you can go back and forth between a macbook, an iphone, and an ipad, simply by selecting the airpods from the device. With these, if I was using them with my iphone, and then I want to use them with my ipad, I need to turn bluetooth off on the iphone for a moment until the buds are ""free"", and then I can connect them to my ipad. Sub-optimal, but not a deal breaker for me./a few pluses.1 - I can side-sleep with these in and they don't hurt. yay.2 - I love that the usb charging plug is integrated into the case. last thing I need is more cables.3 - again, for me, they fit well. Snug, almost to the point of being too big, but they don't bother me. I'm really impressed that they just stay put while I'm running and I don't need to constantly push them back into my ears for fear that they'll fall out./I haven't really had these long enough to have an opinion on the battery life.I haven't tried using these for calls yet, so no opinion on the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AGILVFT4SJ2DBC5KKWH6WSVY6LGQ,1,123,Color: RoseStyle: Pop,"January 11, 2024",2024-01-11,2024-01,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds
R3UWOH4RB5J595,B09HN594TL,5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: First Impressions,MayBae,5.0,"UPDATE:My AirPods are dying and have been constantly dropping Bluetooth with my phone, so I borrowed these from my daughter to wear for the day. I have had the right bud in for 7.5 hours and the battery percentage (which actually does show up on my phone screen in the control center) shows that I still have 40% battery life left. I also have not dropped Bluetooth once (!) and they still feel comfortable and light in my ear. I‚Äôm pretty astounded, actually. My AirPods would have died hours ago. The only issue I had was when I received a phone call. My phone rang, as well as hearing the ringing through the earbud, but when I answered, it did not automatically connect to the earbud at all. I had to talk into the phone normally. I also have noticed a distinct difference in the bass level between these and the AirPods. I don‚Äôt know how much of it has been the slow death of the AirPods, but these sound so much better than the first time I tried them. 10/10. Do it.Old Review:I heard these were a pretty decent earbud set for the price and decided to try them out as a backup set. I‚Äôm coming from AirPod Pro (1st Generation) and prior to that, the Jabra 75t.I have to admit, this isn‚Äôt bad for a $25 set of earbuds. One of the reasons I switched from the Jabra 75t‚Äôs (aside from the fact I had to get warranty replacements TWICE), was because I wanted to be able to use each earbud interchangeably and Jabra did not have that at the time. I‚Äôm actually quite surprised that JLab included the functionality for this price point. The charger being built into the bottom of the case was a nice touch and I appreciate that both earbuds go in the case magnetically, as well as the lid being magnetic as well. It paired easily with my iPhone 15 Pro and my daughter‚Äôs iPad.These are definitely lighter than both my Jabras and Pros. They fit in the ear nicely and I could see myself being able to wear them for a while (doing most things) and not have them fall out. My ears must be different sizes because my Pros consistently fall out of my left ear, but stay pretty good in my right ear.There isn‚Äôt an app for these, so while you can change songs, adjust volume, and use Siri by pressing the buttons on the earbuds, you won‚Äôt be able to tweak any part of the sound. You also will not be able to check the battery percentage and will have to go off the audio prompts it gives you. These also do not have noise-cancelling capabilities (which I honestly wouldn‚Äôt expect at the low price).So, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm taking off one star‚Ä¶the sound. I‚Äôm not an audiophile. I don‚Äôt typically listen to music so the majority of my use is podcasts, audiobooks, or YT/Twitch vids. The sound is a bit muted (‚Ä¶not an audiophile) and not quite as clear as my Pros. For that reason, I likely will not use them unless I need to charge both my Pro earbuds at the same time‚Ä¶and both my Jabra‚Äôs are dead, haha. They would be fine in a pinch, but not something I would choose if my Pros are available.I also cannot speak to the battery life as I haven‚Äôt used them for more than a couple minutes, but what they promise (32 hours) is extremely impressive. I ended up giving them to my daughter to use as she only has over the ear headphones. I will say it‚Äôs a great first set of earbuds for kids as you do get a lot of great features in a lower priced set.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AFM6HO7FF4655PMXN7TUUKEIJ6UQ,1,7,Color: LilacStyle: Pop,"June 7, 2024",2024-06-07,2024-06,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

R39862E1J269M4,B09HN594TL,"3.0 out of 5 stars There may be better (lightning?) deals on buds out there, but these are decent for the price",Xmetal,3.0,"Feb 2024: I am not sure if my current issue is fixable but maybe a day or two ago i noticed the right bud is not working ... it seems to be normal when i put it in the case but it never turns on anymore. The left bud is a-ok. Really this didn't last (note: i did get these used-like new and i have used them a bit) as long as I'd hope but it doesn't change my opinion. For the price (say $19.99) you can do better .. even if you have to wait for say a lightning deal on something like the TOZO T6's for $22.99 or something ... BUT ... i'd not say ""these are horrible, avoid"" ... the sound isn't the best like i said but they are small and really comfortable ... and while they dont have the best sound ... i have heard FAR worse ... just a little EQ'ing and these sound decent for relaxing music (one of my main uses) .. for podcasts or something ... that doesn't matter as much anyway (EQ'ing them) .... I will update this if i find its an easy fix but even a few resets hasn't gotten the right but to turn on yet.April 2023 Update: well ... I see these are $23 now ... I dont think they are worth that much (just a few $1's too high, dont get me wrong) ... but I got mine used-like new for $12.50 and I have seen them say at the $16 or so range ... you know .. these aren't 'great"" but they are not that bad. I think say for podcasts or whatever they are fine ... you can just find better for music (even ""jlab signature"" and eq'ed on top). having said that ... I have used these at night for sleeping and they fit great. I HAVE gotten use to being careful with the built in cable (still not a fan of that though ... if a cable breaks you can replace it... if this breaks, your charging case cant charge the earbuds).I hate to act like any of the buds I still have are ""not comfortable"" but for me, comfort wise, these are up there. As long as you dont expect these to be top quality buds (NOR worst of the low price buds, again dont get me wrong) .. I think people may like theseUpdate 2+ condensed) After using these for a bit, and even counting the best EQ option (Jlab Signature) and a v-shaped EQ on top via Wavelet (app) these still do not sound as good as some other pairs i have, however using them for side sleep (whatever side faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in), these do a surprising good job at passive noise cancelling for me. While they also dont sound the best... they dont sound ""bad"" either ... you can some real no-name duds below $20, .. these are decent for that sub $20 price range to be clear.I gave these 3 out of 5 stars but really its maybe between a 3.5 TO MAYBE a 3.75 to be clear ... maybe more toward 3.5 in my book though. I'd say look at TOZO first for deals ... but I still recommend these.They are comfortable to me too ... like they dont feel too big ... just right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 1) I did notice one day when it was REALLY humid the controls seem to get wonky ... like sometimes my presses weren't ""registering"" and then others would which would mean i'd do a function (change track for instance) when i wanted to change the EQ mode instead... it doesn't alway happen but it has once or twice in constant use since i bought these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have to say the default tips + the size of the buds combo are nice ... I have ( .. even just to test THESE) been using these sleeping at times rather than my TOZO T6's and while i love the T6's i haven't found the ""perfect"" eartips for them that fit me (so to speak) ... at times with these Go Air Pops ... I hardly notice they are in my ears ... I didn't even open the little bag with the other tips to make sure (note: bought ""used - like new"") I got the other tips, yetmy one con that I REMEMBER typing this update is the sound quality ... .ok for the price on ""JLab Signature"" EQ but bang for your buck ... counting deals on Amazon ... you may be able to do better.So far Battery Life seems decent enough ... a little shorter than I expected but like i said i am using these for sleep and i count that time that I am sleeping so .... yeah battery life is good for the price, I'd say--------------------------First I want to mention this is all based on my first impressions after a few hours of use, only ‚Ä¶ things may change later. Bluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZO‚Äôs T6‚Äôs and NC2‚Äôs (two pair now), Fiil‚Äôs T1XS with app support, and Edifier‚Äôs TWS1 Pros and Earfun wise the Air Free Pro 2‚Äôs, (Returned due to a number of issues) Earfun Free Mini‚Äôs and to be clear‚Ä¶ Earfun Free‚Äôs that were sent to me unexpectedly after they saw my review of the Free Mini‚Äôs (thank you Earfun) ‚Ä¶ point being is that I have experience with a number of earbuds even if I do use some more than the others (no real particular reason).Right away I noticed these opinionsPros- Fit ‚Äì to be clear none of the buds I have are really ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù in any way but these just fit good, with the default tips ‚Ä¶ or what I am guessing is the default tips (comparing them to the default TOZO T6 tips, they seem the same size) ‚Ä¶. Unless my ear starts to itch or something, I HARDLY notice the Go Air Pops are in my ears. I love my TOZO T6‚Äôs (form factor wise the nearest on the list I mentioned, to the same form factor as these)‚Ä¶ but these just seem to fit a little better.Update a few days later (after writing the prior paragraph) ‚Äì these while they have fallen out from time to time‚Ä¶ these are very comfortable. When using them for sleep (whatever side of my head faces the pillow if ‚Äúside sleeping‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have an earbud in) ‚Ä¶ they are more comfortable then the TOZO T6‚Äôs I have used for the same thing before and with these there are times I barely know they are there, and I really like that.- Build quality ‚Äì I will not say these have ‚Äúgreat‚Äù build quality .. that just seems to be overstating it but these do not feel as cheap as the Earfun Air Free Mini‚Äôs. Some ultra budget earbuds have a quality where it just feels like the cheapest plastics and materials were used ‚Ä¶ not the case with these buds, even if they don‚Äôt scream ‚Äòhigh end quality‚Äù either.- Battery Life ‚Äì I am not going to act like I have counted or even really paid attention but these seem to last awhile and even after falling asleep for a bit with these‚Ä¶ I cant say I have ever woken up to them NOT playing ‚Ä¶ since I bought them I had to charge them once and (just in case, I probably didn‚Äôt have to) then a second time, just to make sure the case was fully charged at that point, but I just had no idea the case‚Äôs charge then and it could have been say 70% or something and the second charge was un-needed.I‚Äôd say I am ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù by the battery life being good.------------------------------Pros/Con (??) ‚Äì This may be my least favorite sounding earbud I have but ‚Ä¶ from what I remember of the Earfun Free Mini‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ they do sound better than they did ‚Ä¶ and I love TOZO but I can not compare these with the TOZO A1‚Äôs which I don‚Äôt have ‚Ä¶. say comparing these to the TOZO T6‚Äôs seems sort of unfair as the A1‚Äôs (TOZO brand wise) are more of the equivalent to the Go Air Pops. They could sound the same for all I know.I do notice a difference using the built in EQ‚Äôs (note too that no matter the headphone or earbud I tend to have an EQ setting or app with a ‚ÄúU‚Äù to a ‚ÄúV‚Äù setting applied) ‚Ä¶ but not much ‚Ä¶ I do agree that the Bass Boost mode CAN muddy things up at times ‚Ä¶ the Flat EQ setting ‚Ä¶. makes it a lot flatter sounding (no matter what I listened to) than I was expecting ‚Ä¶ I mean FLAT sounding ‚Ä¶ NOT ‚Äúneutral‚Äù like I‚Äôd describe the TOZO T6‚Äôs for example.The best setting between the three is Jlab‚Äôs Signature sound which boosts the Bass and the Treble in a V like sound signature. Like the Fiil T1XS‚Äôs many EQ options and customization, for instance are nice to have, in my view ‚Ä¶ the default sort of ‚ÄúV‚Äù signature THEY offer is also the best THEY sound. If I am not mistaken .. the ‚ÄúJlab signature‚Äù sound EQ setting IS the default and it does sound the best, like I said.After a few days and a ‚Äúside-by-side‚Äù comparison to the TOZO T6‚Äôs I have (some of the others are in a higher price bracket ‚Ä¶ I am trying to be fair here) the T6‚Äôs do sound ‚Äúsharper‚Äù and ‚Äúcrisper‚Äù ‚Ä¶. sort of hard to describe if you don‚Äôt get what I am saying ‚Ä¶ however, forgetting these I got ‚Äúused-Like new‚Äù for $12.50 ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd sort of say they are worth $19.99 (typical price) ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd HONESTLY spend a tad more for the T6‚Äôs ‚Ä¶.if someone did ask me about these ‚Äúgo air pops‚Äù ...‚Äùyes or no, at 19.99?‚Ä¶ no commentary‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say yes ‚Ä¶ if you note the con‚Äôs (below)----------------------------------------------------------------Cons- The built in charging cable. - I do have to admit I KNEW about this before hand and this was not a surprise ‚Ä¶..A) the length ‚Ä¶ I mean many earbud‚Äôs cable that comes included IS short, but this seems extra short. I may pickup usb ‚Äúextension cable‚Äù to use with these buds which ACTUALLY may solve the other issue ‚Ä¶. anyway I just do not like how short this is, where depending on how you are ABLE to charge this, the case has to be dangling somewhere with all the weight of the buds and the case on the built in cable. To keep it as a built in cable I know they HAVE TO make it small or double/triple the size of the case itself ‚Ä¶ that makes sense to me ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd just rather have a say separate USB-C port + cable for instanceB) I didn‚Äôt even think of this at first but with the prior Jlab model that didn‚Äôt have a top on the case (not sure who‚Äôd like that design idea) ‚Ä¶ but the built in charging cable the way Jlab has it, has the bottom (even when it‚Äôs tucked into the case) pins exposed‚Ä¶ .this seems like a really bad idea for dust/dirt/etc to me but for the record I have only just gotten these and NOT had issues with this yet ‚Ä¶ just something that seems like an oversight or something.- Max Volume - this may or may not always be an issue but especially if you have audio that is not normalized (the default level of the source audio is too low vs what it should be) ... the max volume of these earbuds may not help.I never truly paid attention to reviews saying how loud certain buds are, but I do notice that compared to some earbuds, the MAX volume of these or even ""on tick down"" from max is what i have it on a bit (note: sometimes i do have a black Honeywell fan on next to me) .... when some other buds ... say oh 70% to max (guessing, but it's close) is good for me volume wise. Again this is not always an issue with good source audio or if your not in a loud/noisy place-----------------------------------------Summary (again based on first impressions)I think if you count lightning deals there may be better options when others go on good sales, but these aren‚Äôt bad. I can ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù the sound not being the greatest, but that charging cable A) being so short and B) the pins being completely exposed I do not like and maybe a deal breaker for some.I can‚Äôt say I 100% recommend (I mean counting deals there are better options out there .. even for a LITTLE BIT more in price)‚Ä¶ nor can I say I don‚Äôt recommend (even with issues like I said) ‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt bad ‚Ä¶ as a backup pair or if you are just curious about theses ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say go ahead and give them a shot.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Pop,"April 26, 2022",2022-04-26,2022-04,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

R1Y33AFMMLBEV0,B09HN594TL,"4.0 out of 5 stars For $25 they're pretty decent, but there could be room for improvement.",Nightweeb92,4.0,"I've mostly ever bought Skullcandy headphones as they were generally my ""go to"", I went through about four of their sets before getting fed up with their odd spec listings at certain prices and annoying customer service and warranty.I needed something decent but cheap. The go air pop ended up being a popular choice so I picked them up. Generally I mainly use them for commutes and mowing the lawn (my ears start ringing after long periods of time with a lawnmower so I listen to music to avoid it).The price is great, getting these on sale is even better. They're super light weight and the fit is perfect and they stay in my ears pretty well if I'm not doing extenuous activities that make me sweat, otherwise I'm often pushing them back in, but I do sometimes have a small hassle getting them out of my ears and sometimes the case itself too. They fit in my ear a little too well that I sometimes have to get a good pinch grip to get them put, sometimes it feels like I'm not even wearing them.The build is about as expected, made with a higher grade plastic, they don't particularly feel expensive but they don't feel like dollar store cheap either, they look pretty decent ..though for the case I do wish there were a few changes. For one being the USB cable, instead of having a proprietary cable, they should just have a USB-C charging port instead. Additionally, it would've been nice to get maybe another 1 or 2 LED battery indicators in the front instead of the single one to let users know how much battery life is left in the case.On the inside they should add a recessed section to make it easier to pull the buds out of the case, I sometimes don't have good grip and the buds feel slippery, so I feel like I need to twist the buds to get them out. As for the flip top, they could make the recessed lip a little deeper, the case itself is decent but it's a little too slim that you sometimes fumble with keeping It open to get the buds out, it's sometimes just as slippery as the buds.The touch controls are pretty straight forward and easy to get used to.Sound is good ..if you're mostly into bass heavy stuff, they have a bit of clarity and some detail, but they're not something an audiophile would approve, they're just good general consumer quality. The original go air pop don't have an app so the only customizing users are limited to are the three built-in EQ settings, jlab signature/balance and bass boost.The Jlab signature sound is balanced with a slight bump in bass and treble, they're recommended as a universal sound that sounds good with just about anything. But to me it lacks clarity as some frequencies sometimes tend to mask or overpower other frequencies causing a loss in details.Balanced, is basically a flat meant for things like listening to audiobooks and podcasts, there's more focus and emphasis on boosting vocals while everything else remains relatively flat.Bass boost, is more for people who want more bass ..on top of what already feels like a more than enough bass sound from the Jlab signature sound. It's more meant for working out, but it does have a tendency to overpower the mids and highs most of the time and is the least detailed.Overall sound is good, stick with the Jlab signature sound and that's all you should really need. What the regular go air pop lacks is an EQ to help bring in more details. The Go pop+ is the same model but with a USB-C cable attached and allows connection to the Jlab app for custom EQ.One small gripe I have in color is that they don't have a mint color available for this set (or maybe not yet).And my other small gripe is this only support SBC audio encoding and not AAC which is a step up in audio quality. Yes that means the Go pop+ too only supports SBC. At this price I can't expect this to have something like LDAC support, but the inclusion of AAC would've been nice.Despite my gripes and nit-picks, for the price these are pretty decent and I'd recommend them if you're looking for something decent but cheap, I personally recommend going with the updated Go pop+ as they're the same as the go air pop but with app support and USB-C.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AHBH456GHSTRY32NAQBKZU6SJY5A,1,6,Color: SlateStyle: Pop+,"July 15, 2024",2024-07-15,2024-07,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

I‚Äôm not terrified about losing them like I was with the more expensive ones. They fit snugly (but not too tight) and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with them falling out. The only reason that I didn‚Äôt give them 5 stars is because I find them to be a bit difficult to remove from the case. I also don‚Äôt love how you charge them. It would be easier for me if you could just plug a cord into the case as opposed to plugging the case directly into the c block as the plug in attached to the case is stiff and difficult to pull out from the case. These are the only issues that I have with these ear buds. In all fairness I also have neuropathy in my hands so this is probably a specific issue for me personally.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AHPOWAVYU2RIPWGTZHRF4IWDVSLQ,1,0,Color: SlateStyle: Pop,"July 30, 2024",2024-07-30,2024-07,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

R3C1E4RID4SDBR,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Enough,Catherine Green,4.0,"I'm not good at discerning audio quality, but these earbuds are ever so slightly worse quality than my expensive headphones. But like for the price, that's to be expected. They're good enough for when I don't want to use the bulky headphones.They also don't have a great range. They'll be fine if I walk across the room, but if I start going behind objects or down a hallway, the sound will start to skip a bit. But again, they're fine enough for the price. If you use them with your phone and carry it with you, they'll be fine.I saw someone else say these made their ears itch. Mine itch a bit while using these too, but my ears are sensitive. I only use 1 earbud at a time anyway, so I just switch them out for the other ear when it starts to get itchy after an hour or two. I think that might just be earbuds in general that do that, but I like that I can easily switch them out.I really like that they automatically connect when you remove them from the case, you don't have to turn them on. If they don't detect any paired devices, they automatically enter pairing mode which makes them super easy to use.The magnets in the case are strong and it's a bit hard to take the earbuds out sometimes.For the price, these are great. I hope they last me awhile.Edit: After 2 months, I still like these earbuds. I rarely have to charge them. Occasionally while using them with my TV, the audio starts getting choppy. Putting the earbuds back into the case to disconnect them, then taking them out so they automatically reconnect again seems to fix the problem. Again for the price I think they're adequate for me.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AFK53FA6BDBFPTFOUT66CQ4QLIFQ,1,2,Color: My Little PonyStyle: Pop,"June 4, 2024",2024-06-04,2024-06,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

Being an Apple and tech snob I thought there is no way these could be great like all the reviews said. My AirPods quit working after a few years and at the time I wasn‚Äôt wanting to shell out hundred or more dollars for new ones. I ordered these to wear around the apartment while I clean and when I exercise at the gym. I got them in the mail very fast. When they came I fell in love with the lavender color so much I‚Äôve tried to make it my new signature color for everything lol They are beautiful not only in color but also design. I was being kinda bummed about it having an attached USB cord but once I started using them it has become one of my favorite things about them. When I turned them on and added them to my iPhone fairly quickly and they continue to connect without any issues. Super easy. They fit amazing and come with different size ear pieces. The sound quality for the price that I paid is outstanding. They aren‚Äôt completely as loud as probably more expensive brands but I can definitely afford new AirPods Pro‚Äôs but I have remained more than happy with these and they have lasted me for longer than I thought and saved so much money.

I've got one stashed in my car, my backpack, two of my jackets and one for my PC. They got good sound, but if you're an audiophile you might wanna look elsewhere. I usually use one earbud when walking around or doing chores, so that lasts for a few hours. If I feel like that battery is gonna die, I switch earbuds. I never have to worry about battery life. If anyone is wondering what the difference is between the Black and Midnight colors are. They are basically the same. Midnight is like 5% lighter than black.

I currently use airpods but those often pop out when I smile so I was looking for something more snug.I love the color and sleekness of the case but they leave a lot to be desired. Sound quality it OK. I am used to airpods stopping whatever is playing when removed from your ear. These don't do that so every time you remove it to have a conversation or it falls out, your audio keeps playing. Also, if you need to adjust the buds in your ear, you will likely hit the track forward or back button.They are certainly more affordable than many options but I will keep looking for something with a better fit.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2024",AGUXWV4NA7IQZR5PNJ5VPRZFNQTA,1,0,Color: VioletStyle: Pop,"July 12, 2024",2024-07-12,2024-07,JLab,JLab Go Air Pop - True Wireless Earbuds

Great sound, easily chargeable and I‚Äôve never had a pair of headphones for this long. I use them with my iPhone 14+ and they work great and the color is cute. One thing I will say is since I use them every day, cleaning them is a must. The speaker screen has fallen off a couple times but I am able to place it back correctly after cleaning and put the ear bud back on. Also the longer you use them the faster you have to recharge them every night, but for the first 6 months I could go days without charging, but again I use them every day so maybe they‚Äôre just getting old.

Next step was to get them out of the case and try them out. That was a bit more difficult then I expected‚Ä¶had a tough time getting them out of the case. The buds kept slipping out of my fingers. Didn‚Äôt expect that, but eventually got them out. Oh, kudos for the built in usb plug on the case although some people may not appreciate the ‚Äúold‚Äù usb a plug. I didn‚Äôt care, so I was happy to just plug the unit into a charger.Now to actually test the buds out. Simple connect to Bluetooth, fired up a music streaming app and‚Ä¶.then spent a half hour trying to fit the buds in my ear! Eventually had to switch the ear pads to a smaller size, and was ready to go!Listened to a few tunes‚Ä¶sounded ok, but a bit ‚Äúthin‚Äù and a little bright. But I had the next day to really give the buds a listen! Turns out, bad decision. Next morning I started to listen in earnest, various genres of music, at different volume levels. Everything was going great until I got the bright idea of testing out the buds while mowing my lawn! Yeah, bad, really bad moves. Lost one of the earbuds somewhere in my back yard! Spent hours crawling all over the yard with my cellphone trying to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù Bluetooth to the missing earbud! It‚Äôs gone, now days later the battery in the earbud has surely died, to be found nevermore!Hence the 3 stars for initially sounding ok but being a pain to fit them in my ear!

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5.0,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 11, 2022",2022-08-11,2022-08,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5.0,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world‚Äî they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.‚ÄîTHE SOUND‚ÄîBoth the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!‚ÄîCONNECTIVITY‚ÄîThese connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don‚Äôt need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.‚ÄîFIT‚ÄîThe fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)‚ÄîTHE CONTROLS‚ÄîThe controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON‚Ä¶ which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button‚Äî it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.‚ÄîBATTERY‚ÄîThe battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?‚ÄîRANGE‚ÄîVery good, about 30+ feet‚ÄîCONS‚Äî-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn‚Äôt as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds‚Äî these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you‚ÄîUPDATE‚Äîthey have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case‚Ä¶ which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived‚Ä¶ only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,562,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"September 28, 2023",2023-09-28,2023-09,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control.

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4.0,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 3, 2024",2024-08-03,2024-08,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3.0,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it‚Äôs like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it‚Äôs not straight up refusing to connect it‚Äôs disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that‚Äôs a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn‚Äôt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"May 25, 2024",2024-05-25,2024-05,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I'm no audiophile but they sound great for the price I paid. They are comfortable and light. They look great but the case is big. The mic isn't too good but works when needed. The color is really what I got them for. She loves pink. She has really small ears and the headphone ear plugs that came with these were all too big. We swapped them out a few months later and haven't heard anything about it yet from her. So I'm assuming they are working great. She dropped one into the sink and they were soaked and stopped working for a few days I riced them and blowdried them and they came back to life. Still sound as good as ever.

R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4.0,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it‚Äôs a solid product but there‚Äôs something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They‚Äôre small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don‚Äôt know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that‚Äôs just it, they‚Äôre alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it‚Äôs understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I‚Äôm also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There‚Äôs something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that‚Äôs just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I‚Äôm sorry, but they do look a little‚Ä¶funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the ‚Äúb‚Äù logo is upright. They don‚Äôt stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you‚Äôll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that‚Äôs beyond pretty much anyone‚Äôs control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don‚Äôt do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn‚Äôt say these are the best I‚Äôve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating‚Ä¶the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 27, 2021",2021-06-27,2021-06,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4.0,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it‚Äôs there for both buds plus case.They‚Äôre not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They‚Äôre more noise reducing, so if that‚Äôs your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it‚Äôs just enough to say it‚Äôs there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what‚Äôs pictured.They‚Äôre extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 24, 2024",2024-07-24,2024-07,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3.0,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn‚Äôt even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it‚Äôs quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I‚Äôm considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can‚Äôt fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product‚Äôs popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I‚Äôll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 24, 2024",2024-07-24,2024-07,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

These headphones are, in fact, a cut above their competitors at cheaper levels. These things connect seamlessly with my Galaxy s23, and are pretty much rolling by the time you slide them in your ear. On that note, they do tend to wiggle out under any real activity (constantly adjust in the gym, definitely gonna fall out in SE Louisiana heat this time of year, luckily i could hear them when i put my ear to the grass to find them, so dont work outside with em.Overall i am impressed and kinda just kicking myself for not spending even more for a better fitting pair of buds.

Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible.

Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller.

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

A light texture added just to the grip area would solve this without noticeably disrupting the cosmetics; something for the designers to consider.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AGCJX4UIM2UJ4ZEAVA6EFZMQOJNA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The volume can still be controlled using the buttons on the buds so I'm just really confused about play/pause not working and since I got these for work I need to be able to easily and quickly pause my audio if a client comes in. I contacted support and if the issue can be resolved I'd be happy to update to a higher review.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AFPOYFUPNAJELC6GJJCDTY7NI4UA,1,3,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,2024-05,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I did have to switch the size of silicone part on my earbuds to a smaller size that didn‚Äôt come with my set but after that I didn‚Äôt have any problems with them falling out. I bought mine in November 2021 and for the last year, I am realizing they don‚Äôt stay charged as long as they previously once did. When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. That‚Äôs the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn‚Äôt last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can‚Äôt hear when people come up to my desk.

Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on üòÜ.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,2023-12,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. I‚Äôm not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldn‚Äôt matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand.

R7D3A3PPZYWTD,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Battery lasts awhile but almost no BASS,John Brandt,3.0,"Very disappointed with these. Not only does the volume not go up loud enough but there is no bass. With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume. I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed. Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear. The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks. Is 150 range too much to ask?","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AET72FSGDTS6GQZHYTRYEST73USQ,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 28, 2024",2024-07-28,2024-07,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4.0,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,2023-12,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5.0,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 31, 2023",2023-12-31,2023-12,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3.0,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 1, 2024",2024-08-01,2024-08,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music‚Äîalso fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out‚Äîinto a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast.

R2ZTC75NUZSKYY,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent for the price when on sale,Amazon Customer,4.0,"Well let‚Äôs start off with I bought these on sale for around $80.If I would‚Äôve paid the full amount of 150 I‚Äôm not going to lie and say I wouldn‚Äôt have been disappointed.Apple bought out beats audio a few years back so I expected more. The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren‚Äôt too compatible with Siri. I‚Äôm a delivery driver so I can‚Äôt always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won‚Äôt read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn‚Äôt always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That‚Äôs the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they‚Äôre decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don‚Äôt fit right.Another thing I might add is that they‚Äôre a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they‚Äôre worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would‚Äôve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it‚Äôs nice that the case charges them. There‚Äôs also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,1,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 25, 2023",2023-12-25,2023-12,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn‚Äôt do any good when their charging box is hours away and you‚Äôre out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don‚Äôt sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable. Very disappointed for earbuds and that price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AE5C4XAN3IXZUKY43ORDV36FPHHQ,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 29, 2024",2024-06-29,2024-06,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R2VH03ZQ648FN,B0BTZKP1TP,"5.0 out of 5 stars First wireless earbuds, and I love them.",Jonny Consumer,5.0,"Never considered buying wireless earbuds before, but needed them for a mix of work/workout and chose these based on reviews. They have multidevice pairing and single earbud use, which were the main things I was looking for.Comfort: The stock plugs were kind of painful, but luckily this came with both larger and smaller plugs. The smaller set fit great in my ears, without ever falling out. I can wear them for about 2 hours and feel comfortable the whole time.Battery: Battery life is very, very good. I don't know the upper limit because I've never hit it. So far both the buds and the charging case hold charge very well.Audio: The audio on these is solid. Not mind-blowing, I've certainly heard better, but solid. Like a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I am not an audiophile so this is more than ""good enough"" for me to use for music and phone calls. If you are an audiophile who needs the perfect crystal sound, you should probably look elsewhere.Form factor: They feel and look good in my ears, though like some reviews say, they are a little slippery. The round small shape and texture make it easy to drop them while putting them in or out. Likewise, the case can close easily, just as you balance to put buds away. Just be careful when doing so.Pairing: These were very easy to pair, and they pair and turn on INSTANTLY when you remove one or both from the case. It's mildly longer to switch if you have them paired to 2 devices, but that's kind of expected.App: The app that comes with these is really barebones and serves no purpose after initial setup. Just use it to set up your preferences, then you'll never need it again.Noise cancellation: I thought this was a gimmick, but it's actually very helpful. You can cycle between full noise cancellation, none, and pass-through. Personally I found pass-through to be unnecessary, with just on and off for NC to be enough. The Noise Cancellation can't cancel out EVERYTHING, but I used it during yard work and it cut the sound of a leafblower down by at least 65%. So it won't block everything, but definitely helps a lot in noisy environments. Similarly at the gym I felt with NC on, I really only heard the music and my own breathing, very little distracting other sounds. Do not use this while driving or crossing streets... it wouldn't be safe.Overall, for the price these are MUCH better than I hoped. Have to be one of the best purchases I've made in a while.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AG474R4F2TZG4EDS3Z5WNBFJZYYQ,1,21,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,"November 6, 2023",2023-11-06,2023-11,Jabra,Jabra Elite 4 - True Wireless ANC Earbuds

I just wanted a cheaper pair while I decided about getting the new Jabra 10s.The sound quality on these is as good as the Elite 7s but there is a definite difference in comfort. These are bulkier and heavier in my ear and they don't stay in as well as the other pairs.I mostly listen to podcasts and pop music, so the fact that these are low bass is plus. I generally don't use ANC, but let's face it, no one buys Jabras if ANC is a priority.It usees the same Jabra app as the other headphones. That app is a huge selling point for Jabras in general. I love being able to change the sound profile and the white noise feature has gotten me through many an hour in a shared office.So, sound quality and Jabra app is worth the $50 I paid, but I couldn't wear them more than a couple of hours. I was happy I found my Elite 7s.

I won't buy this brand again.UPDATE: Customer support was very helpful and offered to replace the earbuds if needed. But an update resolved the issue. Both earbuds hold a similar charge now. Overall the earbuds are reasonable for the price paid.

The best part you get a free 2 year warranty through the app that's awesome. I've used the TOZO for about 2 years but these are top notch for me. The case is so tiny & cute I'm afraid ima lose them. I have absolutely nothing negative to say i just gotta get use to how they go in the case it's kinda confusing but I'll deal with that & get use to it over time. I think these will be my go to's from now on. I be very truthful & honest on my reviews because i know some people just complain for no reason so if you come across my review definitely go with these you can't beat the 2 year warranty, comes with a app, you can use just one if you prefer.

R2L1ANZVDHD204,B0BTZKP1TP,"4.0 out of 5 stars very comfortable, has most of the features found in more expensive earbuds",Win,4.0,"Jabra may not be considered a top brand for tws like Sony or Bose. They weren't known for highest audio quality like Technics or Sennheiser. However, when it comes to comfort, Jabra is second to none. I bought this pair because it's cheap and very comfortable.The Elite 4 has almost everything I was looking for even though it's not the best in any of those categories. First, it feels very comfortable the same way my Elite 7 does. Second, it has ANC and imo, better than the Elite 7. I haven't had a chance to try Elite 10 to compare yet so hopefully the 10 would do better but then again, it's 3 times the price of the 4 so I can't complain. ANC has never been a strong point for Jabra's products anyway but at least it still cut down some noise when I'm in the open.Hearthrough, however, is the best compare to all the other tws that I tried over the years. I remember Jabra was one of the first company came out with the idea to use microphones to allow users to hear the surrounding. My ancient 65t has this feature and that was so many years ago. I think this is one of the best quality in Jabra's tws and this pair still live up to that. Unfortunately, I can't control the level of hearthrough like my other Jabras so that's a bummer but at least it has that feature.The Elite 4 can be used either left or right by itself. What I like about it is it supports a real mono mode. Believe it or not, I have a few, more expensive, high end brands that doesn't support a true mono. When you use the right, you don't get the sound from left channel and vise versa. The Elite 4 combines both left and right so it's perfect for use as a mono.Multipoint is another feature I've seen in Jabra tws since 65t. This one has it too while, again, many expensive pairs don't support it. I have 2 phones so this is a deal breaker for me and Elite 4 delivered.Now, let's talk about some cons. First, this pair is slow to connect. Compare to other tws that will connect instantly after I took them out of the case. The Elite 4 took at least 2-3 seconds. Annoying, yes but I'm use to it now.Another thing I don't like is I can't change anything on the app the way I did with my other Jabras. Can't even customize the control. Luckily, at least they allow you to adjust the eq.So, my conclusion is if you're looking a working pair of tws that has all the features found in top brands. The Elite 4 has about 80% of it without breaking the bank. Just don't expect some fancy things like high res, top tier ANC or million ways of customization. The pair still work really well enough to be a daily driver. It has good microphones even though there're only 4 rather than 6 but I've never get a complain. Very compact and super comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AGOA6VPNL3A4APRLVEK2AV2RZ6HQ,0,0,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,"April 13, 2024",2024-04-13,2024-04,Jabra,Jabra Elite 4 - True Wireless ANC Earbuds

I use my headphones at work and because I drive for a living I so NOT like the noise canceling since I need to hear around me driving in busy NYC. Even with the sound passthrough it‚Äôs not enough. I have to take them out. That‚Äôs most likely because of the silicon tips that the regular AirPods don‚Äôt have.Speaking of, I‚Äôm not a fan of the tips. But that‚Äôs just a personal presence. That‚Äôs one thing I love about the AirPods. They don‚Äôt have tips, and they are comfy and do not fall out most importantly.One thing about the AirPods is the mics LOVE to just stop working. I‚Äôll be outside with them in and still holding the phone to my face because the caller can‚Äôt hear me. Mad annoying with no clear solution for it. I‚Äôve tried them all it doesn‚Äôt work. They work when they damn well please. I didn‚Äôt have this issue with this set. tThey worked every time. Granted not enough time has passed to see if they stop functioning like the AirPod ones but so far so good. You can hear clearly and you can be heard clearly.They work like any other BT headphones. The case charges them. You charge the case with a USB-C cable. I don‚Äôt think it has wireless charging but that‚Äôs fine. The battery life I‚Äôm not even sure what it is. I was never concerned for it. Or had them die. To be fair I don‚Äôt leave em in as long as AirPods because as I stated earlier I need to hear and I feel like they impede that for me so I remove them.I do recommend these for people who use public transportation which is why I gave them to my fianc√©. The noise canceling works great. If you don‚Äôt need to listen to your surroundings, I recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2023",AHLSHNLUSQX2V4FNBKAK3DIWXIFA,0,2,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,"May 13, 2023",2023-05-13,2023-05,Jabra,Jabra Elite 4 - True Wireless ANC Earbuds
R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5.0,"I‚Äôve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I‚Äôd try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The ‚ÄúQuick setup guide‚Äù was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I‚Äôm in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone‚Äôs ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I can‚Äôt comment on failed bub issues yet, it‚Äôs too early, so we‚Äôll see.I didn‚Äôt intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,1,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"December 2, 2022",2022-12-02,2022-12,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5.0,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn‚Äôt want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn‚Äôt really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I‚Äôll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don‚Äôt think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It‚Äôs a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I‚Äôve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I‚Äôve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it‚Äôs naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It‚Äôs really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it‚Äôs nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,1,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"August 5, 2021",2021-08-05,2021-08,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R19VWKTRIXU414,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice for ear buds,Crotorious,4.0,"I've used these ear buds for almost 2 years and strongly considered re-buying them once I started facing issues. When it comes to sound quality, they're good, and the latency is small, but you'll notice it's there. The best part of these ear buds has to be the battery life; these things last all day, and can be fully charged back up twice with the case. Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"December 22, 2023",2023-12-22,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1.0,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (I‚Äôve seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, I‚Äôm a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that I‚Äôve tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, I‚Äôd much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but it‚Äôs better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to really work at all. I haven‚Äôt tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldn‚Äôt care because I don‚Äôt need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an ‚Äúopen box/used‚Äù I would‚Äôve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now. Adjusting my 2 star rating to a 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AE2R5XX5O7LVG57B7S2L22VH2QIA,1,10,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"July 13, 2022",2022-07-13,2022-07,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5.0,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"June 9, 2023",2023-06-09,2023-06,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R2M4WDO3B23EX,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, Horrible mic for calls",billyillyilly,3.0,"The good, these ear buds have a decent battery life, sit well in the ear without falling out (held with just the rubber insert), have good (not great) sound quality. A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system. These ear buds lack the clean treble when the high hat hits and the deep tones of the bass. If you just want sound without worrying being an audiophile they're good.The bad, no noise cancelling... at all! During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"March 9, 2024",2024-03-09,2024-03,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2.0,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently. So now I have just a left side, good-sounding earbud.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AEKYYYRFAHIBUCQXZMRBNGIQET3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"December 20, 2022",2022-12-20,2022-12,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

R30839P76Q86K9,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, good physical construction outside. Elsewhere, not so much",Ben,3.0,"I've owned a few pairs of earbuds, all wired. I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer.

R3RE1QI7DDJ44X,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Good BT earbuds,Photographer,4.0,"I generally prefer over the ear headphones, but I use earbuds only when I am exercising or doing yardwork. I bought a pair of name brand earbuds that was on sale during BF. Long story short, I had to return it because the sound quality was unacceptable.Rather than trying to find a diamond in haystack so to speak, I picked Sennheiser as it is a brand that I have good experience with. Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues.

I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course.

I‚Äôm an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don‚Äôt feel cheap and that plastic also means they don‚Äôt feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I‚Äôve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares it‚Äôs USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that‚Äôs inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why it‚Äôs Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you‚Äôll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you‚Äôll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"November 16, 2021",2021-11-16,2021-11,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R167YMGKLUDYU2,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive rating: Sennheiser puts sound first (as usual),Scott Herron,4.0,"After years of using cheap-o headphones and dealing with cable noise, listening to music with the headphones feels like i'm hearing each song for the very first time. I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chain√©e turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy.

R1HOIBXMUJ3YZ4,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is good, shape is awkward",Jennifer C.,3.0,"These earbuds have a really good sound. And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one. So from my experience, I could not run both of them for 6 or 8 hours continuously.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AEGNAFTHCFQMCNABBLNIN3IRRHEA,1,4,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"July 28, 2023",2023-07-28,2023-07,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

I have had pretty shoddy luck with headphones, but I had heard good things about this brand, so I thought I‚Äôd give them a go. Their sound is overall above average from what I‚Äôve listened to. They‚Äôre not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons I‚Äôve had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of people‚Äôs problems with these is that they aren‚Äôt proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheiser‚Äôs other products, but if you‚Äôre looking for wireless buds, you probably aren‚Äôt really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use. The app lets you tweak the bass, mids and highs a bit so you can get get the sound a bit more to your liking. It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these aren‚Äôt the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but that‚Äôs a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you don‚Äôt hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too.

R2DX8KHP8703FK,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars This one doesn't live up to the Sennheiser name,Nicky,2.0,"I had a Sennheiser full over-the-ear headphones some years ago and was satisfied with it. I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that I‚Äôve used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still don‚Äôt know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them. I would need to take them out of my ears, put them back into the case, took them out to reconnect again. Or sometimes only one earbud got connected with the device after taking both out of the charging case. I would not buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2022",AGUCYTK4WI5QN4KWJ7K43QZ6LSKQ,1,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"December 1, 2022",2022-12-01,2022-12,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

I use these for content consumption at home so don't need all options available like sport buds, remote charging, outdoor or loud environment noise cancelling, etc. Those features cost extra money so I got a great price on these for exactly what my needs are. When they were brand new on the market they cost a lot more. A lot of news channel interviews are with guests not in the studio. They're at their home or office so the sound is of poor quality. I listen to a lot of news in Spanish so with the other factors mentioned it's hard for me to understand. Sometimes there will even be a music overlay which really makes it hard for me to understand.

R2IR64A8EIRYJQ,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Good at first,Nathan,3.0,"So, I have bought alot of earbuds. In the last year I've probably got 5 pairs, because most of them share the same issue. Connection problem.Eventually most earbuds will start disconnecting from my phone, ToZo, ILuv, Senheiserner, ect ect...These earbuds are no exception.Now for the first two weeks these earbuds were perfect, they had great sound, great connectivity, the app worked without issue.But after week two, they started not connecting to my phone, sometimes they would cut out randomly, and I had to restart them. For cheap earbuds, this is expected. Not for $100 pair. However I had bought so many, I was tired of it and gave these the benefit of the doubt.Here I am a month and a half later and the issue alas only gotten worse. I don't know if it's Senheiserners fault, or the particular pair I got, but either way I couldn't put up with it any longer, thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund, and I intend on buying the ""Google Pixel Buds A-Series"" (the ones I was originally going to get)I really wanted these earbuds to work, and I took perfect care of them. I didn't let them over charge, I never dropped them or tossed them once. So I know for a fact that fault wasn't mine own atleast.If you want good earbuds of a similar price, I dunno, this is the most expensive pair I've owned.If you want good earbuds of a cheaper price try the Mpow M30 Plus, I've had that pair for almost two years and they have failed me only twice in all that time (and it was my fault). Or maybe I genuinely just got a bad pair, I don't know. I know when these earbuds worked, they were excellent.I have had great experiences with Senheiser in the past, this is the first time they've let me down.Hopefully this is the last negative Earbud review I ever have to make, we'll see Goggle Pixel Buds A-Series, I'm coming for you next, don't fail me too.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2022",AFHOTNY7QTDBDCLJRYRG2OVX3S4Q,1,2,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"May 7, 2022",2022-05-07,2022-05,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

It is priced pretty competitively, and gives great bang for the buck. The battery life is good, sound quality is great, and passive noise cancellation is also fairly decent, but might have to turn the volume up if in a crowder place. The only gripes I have with it are that the bluetooth drivers are not great, and I have faced several connectivity issues.

I assume the mic is good on these considering the other end never asks twice or asked me to repeat what I've said. I usually have on a single bud while using and that works fine for both listening to music and calling. The battery life is fantastic. I get better mileage out of it compared to the Galaxy buds. Personally I think these are more comfortable than the Galaxy buds and the sound quality is superior to the Galaxy buds. That might not be the case for everyone. The Sennheiser CX is a bit bulky, so angling and fit I could see not working out for everyone. They are snug for me and generally a great fit, however I have had an instance of it falling off once or twice. The best part is price in my opinion, beats the Galaxy buds in sound quality and is cheaper. Personally I like it's design, but it being a bit bulky they aren't the most discreet.

I can wear these from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM without much concern for the battery life.

R36KYYVGPMLU43,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what I'd expect from Sennheiser...,Cody Groat,3.0,"I bought these after I lost my JBL Live 300's. Was looking for something equally as good but for a bit cheaper. Stumbled across these and looked at some reviews. Flossy Carter's review is what gave me the go ahead, but boy was he wrong on this one.These are extremely cheaply made (case and earbuds feel horrible to the touch), the earbuds are uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes, the sounds quality is nothing as you'd expect from Sennheiser. And the horrid app is nearly unusable.Normally I'd excuse the sound quality when you can set your own equalizer, but the app to do that doesn't work half the time. When you launch it, it just flat out doesn't connect to the earbuds. It will show them for a second but then say connection failed. If you get pass this, the app is extremely slow and buggy. Even if the app worked, the equalizer only includes bass, mids, and highs so you can't fully customize it to your liking.For some good points about these earbuds. They are lightweight and don't move around easily in your ear. The magnets to secure the earbuds and close the case feel great. The touch controls are very responsive. The sound queues and tones are clear and easy to understand. And the battery life is good + it charges quickly.So give these earbuds a pass and go with the JBL Live 300's. Much better sound quality, and an app that works. They are $150 retail but frequently go on sale for $100 (I got them for $75 on amazon). You'll also be getting auto play/pause, and a slightly better water resistance rating at IPX5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFL7DAIS7RHT23VDIZF4BZKBABWQ,1,44,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"August 24, 2021",2021-08-24,2021-08,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

I think most of us do, at least anyone looking into something like Sennheiser.That being said, I usually go to Bose, because they have fantastic sound, and, they are the most comfortable for me. The wingtips really help keep them in my ears, and since they're soft silicone, it's comfortable.I typically don't like in ears with this design. They annoy my ears to the point that I just can't wear them for more than an hour. These on the other hand are actually quite comfortable. They aren't the most comfortable thing on the planet, but I find myself able to wear them for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.The noise canceling does leave a little to be desired, but it's definitely present. It doesn't suck the world out like a nice pair of over ears or a really, really nice sent of ANC in ears. But, for the price point, they weren't so far away from things double, or even almost triple the price. They're great.The best thing about these earbuds, though, is their sound quality. They sound absolutely fantastic. Now, if you're a basshead, they probably aren't quite for you. But if you want to hear the nice boomy bass, punchy kids, and sparkly highs; these are fantastic. You can hear the low end a bit better with the bass boost profile, you can even EQ them in app to your preferences. But for me, the take home with these was the solid sound signature. I could hear all of the lower undertones of sound work in the high end, while getting a nice clear sounding low end. Again, if you're really looking for that low end - low kids punch, these probably won't do it for you. But if you want all aspects of your song to stand out equally, these are great.At this price, if you're thinking about getting them. I say go for it.

I tested it with different types of music (rock, hip-hop, spanish, etc), as well as some podcasts. While the sound quality across the board is good, it didn't outperform a $50 pair of Enacfire E90 earbuds I had before they stopped working. When it comes to bass, the old E90's actually did BETTER than these. The comfort is decent, and aren't heavy enough to fall off your ears. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the battery life since these STOPPED working less than 24 hours after they were delivered!Oh and about the failure, I mainly blame their (stupid) ""Smart Control"" app for this. Like I said before, the earbuds worked fine and paired quicky...until I used this dumpster fire of an app. At first, I was able to link the earbuds with the app and then I tried to update the firmware since it was available. Big, BIG MISTAKE. Even though the earbuds were (supposedly) at 90% battery and were recently charged with a fully charged case, I was instructed to put them them back into the case in order to start the update. After doing so and waiting an hour, the earbuds have refused to go into Bluetooth pairing mode.***UPDATE 08/22/2021***After contacting Sennheiser support via email, they suggested that I get a replacement pair, which is what I did. After getting them, I have to say, I now LOVE these earbuds! I don't know why, but this pair sounds a LOT better than the first ones I got. I can now safely say thay sound better than anything else I've tried, including my old E90's. Pairing was simple and fast, using a single earbud was effortless, and the range is fantastic.While I didn't get the 9 hrs of battery life that was advertised, the most I've gotten so far is about 7.5 hrs, which is still great for true wireless earbuds. Regardless of what you listen to, these earbuds sound amazing and have a great amount of bass. While a few have said that these are too heavy for their ears, it wasn't the case for me. I work in a warehouse where I'm constantly on the move, and I NEVER experienced a moment where I felt like these were going to fall off. That being said, I stand by my previous comment where I say that these won't fall off your ears, even if you're moving around. These are rated as IPX4 water resistant, which I'm going to say is legit since the warehouse does get hot and as a result, I do get pretty sweaty.***UPDATE #2, 09/10/2021***I once again find myself HATING these earbuds! After working perfectly for a few weeks, the left earbud of the REPLACEMENT (2nd) pair I got stopped working. Just like the 1st pair, I tried multiple resets, both soft and factory, and I get no audio from left side whatsoever. I also checked my devices' settings and can confirm that they work perfectly and are not the issue. At this point, I probably won't bother contacting support again and will just get rid of them. $130 in the trash thanks to Sennheiser!","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AGCJFB7PLYJWNNGPHSOJ4A2LKAEA,1,57,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"August 7, 2021",2021-08-07,2021-08,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

To my ears they sounded overly bass-heavy and I prefer a flat EQ. They also had all kinds of connection issues with my phone (an iPhone, no less). So I decided to try these Sennheisers out as a replacement, and I'm really glad I did. The clarity and overall sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the Airpods. And the battery life is far superior as well. I take long walks every day with these, and only need to charge them maybe once every other week? Phenomenal.My only two gripes would be 1. the size of the case, which is somewhat bulky when shoved into a jeans pocket, and 2. the rubber tips that are included. Although they do provide 3 sizes (small, medium, large), I found all sizes of the Sennheiser tips to be too shallow for my ear canal, causing the buds to fall out rather easily. However, I replaced the tips with some slightly deeper ones (from an old pair of $30 sony's), and now they fit perfectly with no issue.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2022",AFZ7QT7BY5SUCXWO6MDQELMKKC3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"March 8, 2022",2022-03-08,2022-03,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

They have superb sound quality, but there were a lot of issues I had with them. They were large with annoying battery leakage and fast battery depletion. I bought these in April when I started a new job because I would be taking a train regularly. I wanted something affordable but didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality that I was enjoying before, with a much better battery quality. These really haven't disappointed. They're not quite as good sound as the MOMENTUMS, but they are still very good for $70. I reckon most other brands you'd have to be spending at least $150 for this quality of sound. The battery life is incredible on them and they're my daily use when I'm commuting. The touch controls are great, much more intuitive than the MOMENTUMs. Their size is a massive improvement over the first MOMENTUMS, they do not stress my ears nearly as bad. Couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Sennheiser is the only audio company I purchase from, and they have rarely missed for me. At this price range, it's an automatic recommendation if anyone ever asks. With the MOMENTUM line is was always harder since the price range was generally extreme.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2022",AEUSB2DXODAHBJDWUPWOHJKXRCBQ,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"December 4, 2022",2022-12-04,2022-12,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R1TIH76K4BX9O3,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Painfully Mediocre,Lui,2.0,"Where to start. The (8 HOUR MAX) battery life is valid for only one of the earbuds, the other dies in half the time causing the other to also start spewing its ""Battery Low"" message until you set it back to charge. They say 27 hour only because you get about 3 Charges from the case, which is also Sad. The material they're made of (including the case) provides ZERO grip so you'll most likely have them simply slipping out of your grasp AND your ears. They refuse to stay in even during something as simple as a light walk, you'll find yourself constantly having to push them back in place. As for the connection, it's Horrid. As many other reviews state, sometimes one bud doesn't connect and you have to factory reset them about three times in a row to fix the issue. The Range is hot garbage. Doesn't even extend down a 12 ft. hallway. My 7+ year old Skullcandy Hesh headphones have a longer range. A joke to be sure.

I can hear vocals, instruments etc with excellent detail in the mids, highs, lows. I am currently listening to Angelina Jordan exclusively right now and it almost sounds as if she is here with me. I know her well as my dearest friend and have an intimate knowledge of her voice in person. Through these Sennheisers her voice sounds great. Sennheiser has done it for me. I am totally satisfied. She and I compared them the other day to a pair of very high end buds given her by the record company as a gift. The ones she had were at least four times the cost of these Sennheiser but neither she nor I could hear much difference. Of course her hearing is much better than mine but still she agreed with my assessment.

This means that when they are on your ears or in your ears, you feel like the sound is outside of your ears instead of right in your eardrum. This creates a soundstage with more depth and clarity. These are not the headphones to bump your trap music to. These are headphones to enjoy great acoustic music, classical music, jazz, watch movies, and enjoy some rock music. With rock music, it should be understood that you will get a nice open sound, but that you will not be getting the blistering loudness that comes with other headphones, especially wired headphones. In some ways this is a better things, especially in regards to your long term ear health.I am 2 days into enjoying them, so I will update if the charging and individual earbud dying issue comes up.

I really enjoy the equalizer that's on the Sennheiser app. It has many presets and also allows you to create your own preset based on what sounds better in certain situations and certain genres of music you are listening to at that time. My only complaint is the noise cancellation. Actually it's not even a complaint because these headphones don't claim to have noise cancellation.

The bad- the worst thing to me was that they kept falling out of my ears and even the smallest cover for the ear bud part wouldn't fit in my ear. That might be just my ears but it actually would start hurting if they were in for longer than 20 min or so. And they fell quite often.

App that was suggested also helped to make the experience better and things went pretty smooth once I was able to figure out the equalizer. There is a sign up option to get a more user experience friendly equalizer which is great but it doesn't take that long to sign up and get into it. You can use one at a time as well and they have a long distance before they start to break up in signal. The bass is great and it isn't over the top. The feel of them and weight of them is perfect so no issues. It even latches into your ears pretty well so I had no issue at the gym with them.

RSSYA1ZUT9YI6,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Too many connection issues,Sierra,2.0,"I've had these for a few months now and I've noticed I've had a lot of connection issues with my earbuds from the start. I use them every day and too many times have one earbuds connection been much weaker and the volume is drastically lower than the other (happens with both ear buds) and turning them off and on again and returning them to the case isn't enough and I'll have to repair my earbuds. I've had to do this every few weeks, sometimes even a few times in a week and pairing them has proven to be much more difficult than it should be. Often it said the earbuds couldn't be paired even though they were turned on and full battery. Another thing, my left earbud will die almost an hour before my right one does, and I make sure to clean them well so they charge.My left earbud also has the most connection issues as recently I'll hardly tap it or move my head and the earbud will lose connectivity and buffer a lot. I never listen to my earbuds with more than half volume as I don't need it because the sound quality is pretty good, but that means I know my speaker isn't blowing out and there's just issues with the manufacturing of this product. I never had these issues with my galaxy earbuds, and am quite frustrated. Other than these issues, they have good quality and potential. Hopefully it's just my earbuds that are like this and not the product as a whole.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2022",AHNMLAD5TCX67UDZIRG34YCIUXYA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"April 18, 2022",2022-04-18,2022-04,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds
R2TFFHXODEW9TJ,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Problems With Connection,Hydromantes,2.0,"I recommend that you do not buy Sennheiser earbuds. Like all manufacturers, they will change the name of this model if they have not already done so to deflect their products from bad reviews so I can't trust anything they make.I've used these for over a month now and they keep disconnecting. I use them for several hours every day and this happens three or four times each week. If there is no audio for a few minutes, they disconnect but they will re-connect with a single click which is a minor inconvenience. However, they also just stop working randomly and will not re-connect at all. That could be a problem connecting with Bluetooth, but often one earbud will continue working when the other earbud is dead and must be re-charged. That proves that it is not a Bluetooth problem but a problem with the earbuds. Even after recharging, the dead earbud will not always re-connect easily. Frequently I need to remove them from my Bluetooth list then re-pair them which is a major inconvenience. I used to have a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones that also would not stay connected. It seems Sennheiser doesn't know how to make something that will connect to Apple devices, which is too bad because they sound great and I like the controls.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AG26TQWV757VVM7CQB7OTPND3ESA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"February 10, 2023",2023-02-10,2023-02,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

Everyone has different hearing, individual preferences and varying levels of ability to detect (or even care about) audio fidelity. First impression out of the box: Well-made and beautifully packaged. It took me far too long to figure out why they weren't charging; turns out there was plastic film over the terminals, which I don't believe the documentation mentioned. (The documentation is pretty lame, btw...) Once over that hump, as soon as I got them connected to Bluetooth and to the app, it asked for a firmware update; this took an incredibly long time. First impression of the sound: crisp, clear, not quite loud enough (for me), but the low end is sorely lacking. Treble perhaps too bright. The EQ inside the app is pretty clever and helped improve the sound, but I was still hoping for more...ooomph...presence...<insert other audiophile words>. (For reference, I was listening to Spotify Premium (highest quality) over Bluetooth.) Phone call performance is excellent. Fairly comfortable/good fit. Overall, these are probably better than I'm making them sound.

The main issue is that sometimes one or both headphones will stop working or desync from my phone for no reason and with no solution. I have gone months (Multiple times) with only one headphone working while the other one blinks red and green like a Christmas tree only to fix itself randomly months later. Again, this has happened several times with both headphones. Sometimes for days, sometimes for months. They have also reset any settings that I had changed in the Sennheiser app, so that's useless.And to add insult to injury, they sound just as good as the $30 TaoTronics I had a few years back. Not bad... But you won't be catching any fine detail in your music. Definitely not worth the asking price.Just don't buy these.

R15SS8YU8XZZQV,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound but lousy reliability,Edward Smith,2.0,"I bought these based partly on the good reviews. They have a well balanced sound. Not heavy on the bass and great mid range clarity. My only issue with them is that one or both keep malfunctioning. One of the ear phones stopped producing any sound, so I sent them back for warranty service. The returned ear phones worked fine for a month, until one of them stopped working. I sent them back again for warranty service. The pair I have now are mostly OK, but occasionally, like today, one stops producing sound. I sort of ""reset"" them by placing them back in the case for a minute. So far that has worked - they both start working again. I have no idea if I've been getting replacement pairs, or if the original items were serviced. If they keep sending back the same pair then I'm just unlucky to have bought a lemon. If they are replacing the ear phones each time then there is a serious overall quality issue.I have one month left on my warranty and I worry they will fail for good after that date passes.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AHWIAWC4IF2O4X34PPGXSEHJHUFA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,"September 9, 2022",2022-09-09,2022-09,Sony,Sony WF-XB700 - Extra Bass True Wireless Earbuds

I think after another two months or so.Don't buy these earbuds. You'll keep spending money getting them fixed.--- Original Review ---I'm afraid I'm experiencing distortion on these things that I don't on my cheap MDRXB55AP Sony earbuds.It's not on all audio sources, but too many. It's the high base sound right around the early voice range.Not always, but often enough.Look, I paid $25 for these cheap Sonys and they just sound better than these $80 Seinheissers.I'm on an S22 with the AptX codec running.My S7 with those cheap Sony wired earbuds produced better sound.Update: The sound is still the same, but I upped it a star, because these things are so convenient.I can leave my phone upstairs and walk around the whole house without losing signal.The battery life is very good too. Six hours? Then you can put the things in the charging case that has a battery in it to charge on the go.Each earbud operates solo if you need it.Comfort is so so. Took me awhile to get used to it.

With both pairs they wouldn‚Äôt charge and if I was able to get them charged then they would connect to my phone. And trying to rest the earbuds requires both earbuds to be charged and in the charging case. But that‚Äôs just the problem that‚Äôs my issue they won‚Äôt charge so some days I was just wasn‚Äôt able to use them at all. Overall very disappointing experience.

I love green so a matcha color was perfect but there are very bug issues with it. 1st big issue is the charging, the buds dont always snap in to the case and connect with the magnetic prongs that charge them leading to me having to push them down (not hard but still) in order to make their they charge and often check on them. This also doesn't help thay their aren't really any indication lights other than 1 one the Case so unless you plug it up you really ain't got a way of knowing if the case is charged or not. Issue 2 the pairing & connecting, the right bud when pulled out with reconnect most of the time but sometimes needs me to manually select them in the Bluetooth menu while the left bud needs to be manually paired each and every time I use it just about, it's as if the bud is able to have a reconnecting memory unlike other skull candy products. 3 issue, this one is very minor but the hinge on the case is just to low you need to hold the cas a very special way or on a table to open or your finger will hold the cases lid shut which is just bad design and I honestly don't know how that made it pass concepts. 4th issue another small one but the Cases lid just opens way to easily when dropped as there's no magnet or just clip helping hold it shut like other brands or even skullcandys just literally sitting ontop of the cases lower part. For 24.99 I expected a product I wouldn't have to fight to use, and for a skullcandy product I expected quality but yet clearly there isn't a lot here in the products functionality.

R2HZ1PX4BEMFYR,B0C2F5KD26,"4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, love the color, long lasting charge",MJ,4.0,"I have been a Skullcandy fan for years. My previous buds the ‚ÄúIndy Evo‚Äù lasted almost 3.5 years. Excellent for midrange $. Hence I immediately returned to the brand for my next bud. I decided to try a different bud now we are in 2024 and the technology has evolved a bit more. Budget matters now more then ever in this economy. After looking at multiple reviews and several different new options they have out, I really was liking these for the look, fit and $. After having them home now and using them for about a week, here is my humble opinion. Pros: LONG battery life. I mean I think I charged it once overnight after it came home and put it on the charger again to check the status and it was still green. It is pleasing in appearance and definitely travels well in a pocket or purse. It has that little charge cord you see in my pictures. The c end goes to the case and usb to your computer, laptop or usb cube. I like the light indicator which tells you how charged the case is. The box comes with three different sized tips to ensure a good fit. The actual bud sits pretty comfortably because of the design. I have small ears and they don‚Äôt hurt after 4+hrs of wear. Decent connectivity. I can leave my phone on the table and walk into an ajoining room. It depends on if there is to much between the phone and signal. If I go out to the yard to lock up the chickens and leave my phone in the house, that‚Äôs about 30‚Äô, I loose connection, but it automatically re-connects when in range. Cons: volume on these puppies with one bud and max volume on my phone is low, I mean like I am struggling to hear. I do have some very mild hearing loss, but I mean I am talking volume on max and it sounds like it‚Äôs on low. I didn‚Äôt have this issue with the Indy Evo. The next and bigger issue is loose fit. Although ergonomically shaped for the ear, they are not secure for me. If I am just sitting working on something and listing or walking around listening not to bad, but as I continue to move my head around you can feel them coming loose. Over time they feel insecure. I constantly fiddle with them to re-secure them in place. I used to take daily walks at lunch with my Indy Evo, not sure I would feel safe doing that with these. I wouldn‚Äôt want to lose a bud or drop it in the dirt. I might try sizing down to the small tips even though medium feels comfortable, just to see if this somehow gives a better secure fit? I miss the little fins on Indy Evo. They pretty much guaranteed those little suckers went nowhere. Overall I think I got what I paid for. In this day and age of technology and insane $$ this is a decent tech, good looking, excellent charge, easy carry and easy on the wallet. If I want something for they gym or what have you I would probably invest a little more money so I get something I don‚Äôt have to worry about possibly losing.

Only complaint is you have no way to skip the track forward and back without using the assistant. Love the switchable equalizer built in. Pairs very well with my Motorola which comes with Dolby Atmos. Bluetooth connectivity works excellent. I can walk into another room in the house, door closed, without my phone and it won't even skip a beat. There are different tones that play in the headphone each time you press the skulls on the sides, so you can count your clicks, which I thought was pretty cool.

Sound quality was excellent with a nice bass. The fit always seemed to need adjusting.A few years ago I tried the sport bluetooth version of Smokin Buds that go around the neck. these had same qualities of the wired version.Now for these wireless Smokin Buds II. I have paired them to 5 different devices: Motorola, Samsung Apple iPhones and an iMac. Sound and fit are excellent. There are 3 built in eq settings: standard, movie and music, that can be changed easily by tapping 4 times on the Skull icon on either earbud. As for the sound the bass seemed deeper on the wired version but not by much.There are small medium and large ear adapters. I believe I am using the smallest ones.There is a charging cradle. You can charge the cradle even when you are wearing the earbuds. When you put the earbuds away the cradle will transfer power to the earbuds without them needing to be plugged in.USB-C charging port with a short USB-A to USB-C cable.Fit: I have shaken my head and the earbuds didn't move. The fit is snug.I have not tried them with exercise yet.Pairing: touch one of the Skull icons for 3 sec. and you will hear ""ready for pairing""For $25 dollars these are excellent, Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AE6XURB2XGIU6KP2TRKMTMEW7NMA,1,20,Color: Matcha,"January 30, 2024",2024-01-30,2024-01,Apple,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

R2B13J5B42HCX8,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars First Impressions,Whyborg,5.0,"Long time fan of Sony products. Have the WH-1000XM4, WF-1000XM4, and other brands. Just got these this morning and listening now. Pretty happy with sound quality, the Sony app helps as I like a punchy bass and have typical high frequency loss for male adults. Once set up with the app, clear bass turned up almost to max and treble up I‚Äôm enjoying the sound. Sounds very much like the WF-1000XM4. Noise cancellation seems similar but need to do more listening in different conditions. Got the XM4 reconditioned and unfortunately the right battery is failing to hold a charge after about a year and a half so got these to satisfy my earbud itch until the XM5 is released. Actually liking the push button as opposed to the touch controls of XM4. Not better, but not worse. A bit smaller which I‚Äôm pleased with as I like to sleep with audiobooks on. I can sleep on my side with a soft pillow and not feel very much pressure. Did have them pause as I have the right side on default to pause and skip but only once so far so I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem. Contrary to some reviews either side can he configured to volume with the app. I have volume on the left now. Single press notches up, holding lowers volume. Default is to switch between noise cancellation or ambient mode. I have cancellation on most of the time so volume is more important to me. Also saw criticism about them not automatically pausing when removing, not a problem to me as I can easily pause touching the right side button. I also have some QCY buds that were surprisingly good for the price, and Soundcore A40 witch were also a good find, paid $99 but now $79. They‚Äôre almost as comfortable as these for bed but protrude a bit further so when sleeping on my side more pressure on my ear than the Sony. So far noise cancellation on the Sony is the best, almost as good as the XM4.For the price, I think this is a very good alternative to the XM4. Battery life is rated to 7.5 hours and the Soundcore are rated to about the same but by early morning I get a rudely loud charging notification. We‚Äôll see how the Sony last with similar use and update this review later. Overall in direct comparison of the XM4 I‚Äôd say these are just about as good but maybe not as broad of a soundstage. If you like Sony or are just looking for a good quality earbud with noise cancellation at a reasonable price these would be a good selection. One major improvement for me is the tips for the buds. I have large ear canals and the memory tips on the XM4 were a huge disappointment, they would not seal in my ears which is terrible for sound quality and noise. I keep all the tips from many earbuds over the years and even with other brands need to dip into them to find larger tips to seal in my ears. Pleasantly surprised the included large tips actually fit me. I included a photo of the Soundcore, QCY, XM4, and the WF-C700N for comparison. The WF-C700N seems to be the most comfortable so far. Slightly smaller than the Soundcore and definitely smaller then the XM4.So after using these about a month I‚Äôm still happy with them. I do have the occasional problem when listening to audiobooks in bed with the buttons for pause or volume getting just a little too much pressure and activating. Fortunately for volume one notch is louder but if you hold it the volume is reduced so at least I haven‚Äôt been blasted by max volume. Much as I like Sony products the other buds I mentioned would probably suit most people fine with a lower cost. But they‚Äôre not Sony! Still anxiously waiting for the soon to be released WF-1000XM5. Hoping for the lighter weight than the XM4 and the comfort of these with touch controls instead of push buttons. But for a mid-price bud these are still my favorites.Another update, these are not working for me to sleep with. My left ear gets a little raw spot on the edge of some cartilage. I‚Äôm primarily using the Sony WF-1000XM5 )got them 2 weeks ago) and the Soundcore A40 for audiobooks in bed. The headphones until my ears get too hot and the A40‚Äôs when I want to lay on my side.The Sony has some edge or something on it that makes a tiny little sore spot on the cartilage in my ear. Still like them a lot but now using them when I do my indoor cycling. I have a couple big blower fans on me and the Sony blocks out a lot of the noise and are better then the QCY I‚Äôd been using. They‚Äôre more rounded and I get less wind noise also.WF-1000XM5 just released, expecting mine Friday. I REALLY hope they don‚Äôt irritate my ear the way these do.So I‚Äôd still recommend these. It‚Äôs probably just my personal ear shape causing me an issue, no problem on the right side but nobody is perfectly symmetrical‚Ä¶8/523Update. Got the XM5 2 weeks ago and loving them. Fantastic sound, lighter than the XM4, better bass, more comfortable. But again the tips don‚Äôt fit. Airtight seal is critical on noise cancelling earbuds. The app is the same for The 700‚Äôs and XM5 but the 700‚Äôs do not have the feature enabled that checks for a seal. I discovered the left bud on the 700‚Äôs and the new XM5 just won‚Äôt quit seal. I found a hack to make the tips moldable. If you get Sugro glue (kind of like clay) roll a bit up, pull up the mushroom part of the ear tip, take the rolled up piece of Sugro and wrap it around the fitting to the bud, roll the tip back down and now you have a moldable tip. Insert in your ears and make sure they a good seal. You may have to reshape it a bit with your fingers if you work it too much. Once you have a good seal let it set a few hours and now you have a fitted tip. Works with my big ear holes‚Ä¶I have to reiterate, the 700‚Äôs have a very pleasing sound once you get the equalizer and clear bass setting adjusted to your taste. I just finished using them for 4 hours straight on loud during a 2 hour indoor cycling session, walking the dog, and making my lunch. Enjoying music I haven‚Äôt listened to for too long. They were comfortable (almost forget they‚Äôre in) sound excellent, and just put them away with 50% battery left.I really think most people would like these and would not be disappointed in any way, especially at the price. The XM5 are better, but to most people probably not $200 better (but I love them too!).9/22/23 a note about the app and the codecs used. I feel like a dummy now that I finally noticed right at the top in the headphone connect app it tells me on my iPhone it‚Äôs definitely using the AAC codec and shows if DSEE is on or not. DSEE definitely improves the sound. Compared the noise cancellation against the WF-1000XM5 and the XM5 do a better job with the 2 blower fans I have on me during my indoor cycling. But I still prefer using the C700n just because I want to be very careful with the more expensive buds.10/23/23Lost these! Looked all around but can‚Äôt locate. I was able to replace them @ $88 so not hugely upset, ordered a new pair and happy all over again. One of the reasons I really like these is how light they are.

R11HJEV7XJYDDM,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running and comfortable,Rick,5.0,"I typically run anywhere from 20min to 1 hour several times per week. I also sweat very heavily. To the point where clothes and towels are soaked.After trying half a dozen ear buds... The Sony c700n is the only one that stayed in my ear the whole time without falling. And they did so comfortably. The fit, comfort and grip is just phenomenal. It's almost as if Sony designed these for my ears. The default ear tips they came with the buds miraculously worked and I didn't even have to try the others.Some of the grip and stability is probably due to the weight of the buds as they are very light and sit very well in your ear.Flagship models are obviously fine but they have a huge disadvantage to runners since they are a lot bigger and heavier and therefore lose some grip and stability.The sound quality on the C700s is excellent as compared to my Galaxy Buds Pro 2. Honestly I can't tell the difference in quality. Even without the advanced codecs.ANC is probably where I see a difference compared to my Galaxy Buds. The Samsung ones are better but not by leaps and bounds. Id call the Sony c700 adequate and works sufficiently well at the gym to block most noise. With music on you won't hear any outside noise.Phone calls is an are where these struggled for me. I can hear other people just fine and clear... The issue is other people cannot hear me... Complaints I often hear is that I sound very far away and the noise cancelling for some reason does not work well during calls. Calls I made in moderately loud places were a near disaster. If you're in a quiet environment maybe they will work better. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update.I can't fault these buds though... I got them for sports/running and good audio quality... And for my use cases I am blown away! Especially at the price point.I prefer the push button interface rather than touch sensitive while running. This is because sometimes I need to adjust the buds without activating any commands. Touch sensitive earbuds are annoying for this matter. Sony designed the buttons well and they are easy to operate. It goes without saying that I can adjust the earbuds without accidentally activating any commands.The case could not be better for gym and sports. It is small, light and minimalist. Love the texture and they are small enough to keep in my pocket without noticing. Given the price point of the buds, I also wont mind if they get scratched of dented. The design is very practical and the ""rough"" plastic texture looks very nice to me.The app is very simple and works well. Besides software updates you can also adjust EQ to your liking. The app is very minimalist but gets the job done. I haven't explored the additional app features yet mostly because I don't think I have a use case for them.Buy these for the gym, very good audio quality and adequate but not stellar ANC. Do not buy these for personal or work phone calls.For the price, it is hard to believe the value these buds offer.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AGUBP7OHOLRD4H67LLYJZLHRWHFQ,1,92,Color: Black,"June 16, 2023",2023-06-16,2023-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II

R2D95JSE3TO700,B0BYPFNW6T,1.0 out of 5 stars Will not enter pairing mode. Ever. Horrible instructions.,Verskate,1.0,"Update: Feb 2024 After having these for about 6 months, I figured out the pairing issue. It's hard to explain but it is done using the Sony Headphones app and disabling the option for connecting to more than 1 device at a time.New issue - charging. Actually not new, but every now ant then the earbuds just won't charge. You place them in the container, the light turn on and glows green, then shuts off. All the while 1 or both earbuds will be just about empty on battery life. So you have to play the game of removing them from the case, placing them back in the case, over and over. That doesn't work all the time either, so then you need to plug them into a power source and remove/place in the case until you get a solid orange light that doesn't disappear in 2 seconds. It's a pain in the a$$. Especially when you know the case has a full charge and you want to use the earbuds only to find out 1 or both are dead. Huge let down from Sony. Calling their support line, maybe I can get a different pair. These suck.Maybe I just got a bad set, but these are the absolute most difficult earbuds that I've ever owned. I've factory reset them at least 5 times and have wasted a good 2 hours of my life trying to pair 2 different devices. The instructions to pair a second device are to place the earbuds in the case, leave the lid open, hold the button on the back for 5 seconds. Sounds easy right? Nope. It's not. The buds will not enter pairing mode. Ever. I can connect to the first device, but good luck with the second. One thing I did learn when I was able to get two devices to pair, that one time, was to be sure to disconnect the earbuds from the first device. Besides the over-complicated method of entering pairing mode, I've had the earbuds only connect one bud, on a few occasions. So you'll get 1 bud to connect, and the other is dead. Trying to get them both to turn on was another clunky nightmare and I ended up just factory resetting them. I'm done messing with them, and they're going back to hell where they came from.UPDATE - If you're using the ""Headphone"" app on an Android and want to connect to ""pair"" with a second device. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON SONY'S WEBSITE. They will only mess up your earbuds and make you frustrated. In the app under ""status"" locate the ""Connected Device(s)"" and tap that. The next screen you'll see a + button on the bottom right. Click that! That will put the earbuds into pairing mode. Good lord they made that difficult. 2.5 hours later I have them paired.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AEWFIZHWBDHIZY7EAHSDIM6SXYMA,1,36,Color: Black,"August 23, 2023",2023-08-23,2023-08,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II
R1MGV1XOWJJUS5,B0BYPFNW6T,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent Sound, ANC Not For Airplanes",Artie Deco,3.0,"These are not bad. They fit my ears well. They are reasonably loud, but they won't be overpowering.The frequency response is pretty good. The associated phone app gives you some equalizer control that helps, too.There is some configurability for the buttons. Not completely customizable, as the actions are grouped across numbers of clicks (e.g. 1: pause, 2: next track, 3: previous track are a group). But I like the defaults, anyway.I also like the tactile buttons. You rarely accidentally push them while adjusting the buds, unlike touch buttons. There is definitely a significant delay for them to respond (I'm guessing a lot of this is waiting to see how many clicks you're going to do to determine which action to take), so the actual mechanical click lets you know you've pressed them.They did not hurt at all, even on 9-10 hr flights.And the battery life so far is crazy good. With ANC enabled, they were still about 15% after use for those entire long flights. Without ANC, they were like 80%! (That'll likely change with age.)But, the ANC is not useful for me. I bought these for airplane travel. A very old set of ANC headphones did wonderfully eliminating the airplane noise. These, not so much. They physically seal well, so they block sound pretty well with no ANC enabled. In the airplane, turning on the ANC changes the sound, but seems to trade one you can hear for another at roughly the same volume. On one 9 hr flight, this was a bit preferable. But it didn't make much difference on the other. They also didn't block crying babies better with ANC than without. However, they were plenty loud to drown out that noise with or without ANC.The passthrough mode is functional, but poor quality. It lets though the ambient sound, but it somehow boosts actual noise. Airplanes have air blowing all the time. Without the earbuds, you don't really notice it much. But with these in & turned to the monitor mode, the hiss of the air is very loud. But again, it's still functional for listening, even while being annoying.As mentioned, I bought these for airplane travel. I have Google Pixel Buds that have no ANC. Comparing to these, the seal is better with the Sonys, even though the ANC doesn't do much for airplane noise. And the equalizer allows adjustments that the Google Buds don't. Including the battery life & buttons, I've decided to keep these. But just be aware of the ANC limits.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AECD3NAKI2EFV3AV2WSRPK3ZRQFA,1,36,Color: Black,"June 7, 2023",2023-06-07,2023-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II

R1QMGR8WHUBKMQ,B0BYPFNW6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Beyond Expectations for Budget Earbuds,Trenton,4.0,"I can be pretty sensitive to noise, so I've been looking for a good, yet affordable set of noise-cancelling headphones for a while now, but have always been wary of cheaper models. I decided to give these a shot after listening to Sony's C720N's, and so far I've been pleasantly surprised!Noise-Cancelling:What really blew me away was the quality of the noise-cancellation for the price. I didn't have high hopes given that I only paid around $100, but after using these for the past week I've been pretty satisfied with their performance. I would say these earbuds are really good at filtering out lower-end noise, like fans, traffic, and TVs as well as more distant sound. I walked past an industrial AC unit on my way to work the other day and barely heard the thing, especially with music playing. These don't really excel with dealing with higher-end or particularly loud noises like close speech, dogs barking, or sirens, but they do significantly lower the sound, which is incredibly helpful for me. Turning the NC on with music playing is usually enough to block out the majority of offensive noise.Audio:The sound is also really well-balanced right out-of-the-box with good low-end and clear mids and highs unlike the flat or muddy sound you might get with other low-price headphones. Sony's app also allows you to customize your EQ further to get a mix that better suits your preferences, which is really nice. Speaking of the app, you can customize what the buttons on each earbud do through it and toggle the Adaptive Noise-Cancelling setting as well.Comfort:The earbuds themselves are honestly pretty comfortable and fit in my ears snugly. I don't feel them come loose at all as I'm moving about, and I can wear them for hours at a time without much issue. I haven't tried exercising or running with them yet, though. I have been running into a bit of discomfort in my left ear after a couple hours of wear, but I think that may have more to do with the shape of my ear since my right side is fine. I've just been letting the left earbud sit slightly away from the ear for now. which has been helping mitigate any discomfort with out sacrificing any noise-cancellation.Battery-Life:I use my earbuds with noise-cancellation on for at least two-four hours each day. When I'm done using them, they go back into their case to charge. In the week since I bought them, I've only had to charge the case twice. For me, that's not bad at all. The case has an LED indicator to let you know when your charge is getting low, and you can also check it via the app. Charging only takes a couple of hours.All in all, I've been pretty happy with these. I think they're a surprisingly good pair of earbuds for the price. The noise-cancelling of course won't compete for Sony's top-end models, but these do the job and they do it much better than expected.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AHQFE3IETHLN5VJGRSROS3ZIEGOA,1,36,Color: Black,"September 24, 2023",2023-09-24,2023-09,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II

R54TAZM3P539,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars True ANR Nlise canceling,DD1550,5.0,"For those of you who want to purchase this product PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW. I'm going to try and make this short and accurate as possible. Many will tell you that the ANR noise reduction is just a bunch of white noise. THIS IS FALSE! This Bluetooth headset has two modes. ANR and a mode that is sort of a surround sound microphone mode. You can toggle between ANR and surround sound microphone mode with a single tap of the left headset button. You will know when you are in ANR mode because it will be very difficult to hear anything you are surrounded by while you have these headphones in your ears. You will also notice the sound of the music you are listening to is very sharp and clear with lots of bass. The surround sound micro phone mode helps you to hear the environment around you. They sort of turn into microphones and amplify surrounding sounds so you can hear them. This is too often misinterpreted as ANR white noise. Often when wearing these, you will get someone walking up to you talking, trying to communicate, but whatever they are saying will be inaudible if in ANR mode. If this happens, tap the left headset button once. This stops ANR mode and you will be able to hear them talking while still hearing music playing. For best results, tap the right headset button, it stops the music or whatever you are listening to. Then tap the left headset to get out of ANR mode so you can hear the person or environment you are in without removing the headphones from your ears. Its a really cool feature to have on these. The battery life is ok. My headphones will stop functioning at about 6.5 hours of use. Which is acceptable for me for the price. If 6.5 hours of use sounds ok for the price you pay for these, then get them. They are a good bluetooth headset for the money and DON'T LET THE REVIEWS WITH MISLEADING INFO BE A DECIDING FACTOR!!","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AHDOGFOOXLQ6SC2NVWODUFM4QRRA,1,16,Color: Black,"February 11, 2024",2024-02-11,2024-02,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II
RWT29BUJJGM1V,B0BYPFNW6T,2.0 out of 5 stars For the Money - Not impressed.,Granular,2.0,"I bought these earbuds to replace a set from a different manufacturer that started to not accept charge after around 3-4 years.First thing I noticed was the clunky application you are encouraged to download to make the most out of the ANC and Audio features. The product comes with literature telling you straight up - Made for Iphone/Ipad.. Works with Android - so right away, I felt a sense of dread because I'm an Android user.Through the setup process, you are asked if it's cool that Sony collects all of that sweet information about who you are, how you use the device, your mother's maiden name, etc.I clicked yes, because the audio without the app was on par with the 20 dollar set you can buy at the gas station. WITH the app, you are then asked if you want to install ANOTHER app that will make full use of the ""capabilities"" of the new earbuds you just bought.. for ~$100.. and that you MIGHT have to pay the digital audio fluffers a subscription to use their services. I declined this option and decided to see what the Sony app could do to digitally optimize the sound quality with what I assume are cheap and (too) small audio drivers.Long story short:-The bass is lacking.. seriously lacking - you have to turn the bass setting up to max to achieve what I would consider normal for an in-ear earbud.-The mids and highs are ok - nothing special about the sound.-The active noise cancelling is ok - probably better than the set it was intended to replace (but those were 4 years old.. and older model when I bought them)If you're going to spend ~$100 for a set of everyday use earbuds, I would look elsewhere. The set of Jabra Elite Active 75T's this was supposed to replace blow these away in terms of audio quality (no I don't get paid to write reviews.. yes I only write reviews when a product fails to meet my expectations).Unfortunately, I need these for work over the next few weeks - so I won't be returning them.. but I am VERY Underwhelmed.-","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AH7EAOWJE7ETS2SCSOQDAI7OBHEQ,1,0,Color: Black,"July 21, 2024",2024-07-21,2024-07,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II

I got these to replace them both. Not only do they sound better than either of those buds, they fit way better too. I got mine for under 100 dollars, which is basically a steal for how much I love them. I also can't get enough of the physical button on the side in lieu of just having touch controls. The buds are secured in the carrying case with very strong magnets. Would recommend if you aren't going exclusively for the noise cancelation. It's fine, but not class leading.

Like most Sony electronics, they're just a little bit better and more thoughtfully designed than the competition, in almost every respect, from the audio quality, to the crispness of the button press, to the way they snap effortlessly into the case, to the finish and feel of the plastics used in the buds and their case.The Jabras are slightly better acoustically and have wireless charging, but they're almost twice as expensive and have slightly less refined build quality. For example, the case is smooth plastic without any distinguishing notches to facilitate no-look use, and the buds are kind of confusing to put back.The Ankers are just great, too, but they're a shade less robust in audio quality and a little flimsier.

R2EFM9QEJB3NTK,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound and Functionality,ETaylor,5.0,"I am impressed with everything about these earbuds.TL;DR--Great sound quality. Quite comfortable. Surprisingly good app. Easily customizable features. Consistent, reliable bluetooth connectivity. Overall, outstanding value.BACKGROUND: The last set of earbuds I owned were non-brand wireless buds that cost about $40 a couple years ago, and they were garbage. In the meantime, I've used a pair of compact Bose on-ear wireless headphones, which are incredibly comfortable and provide amazing sound clarity, but I wanted something smaller and easier to carry around for use at the office. All further remarks about these Anker earbuds are in comparison to my Bose headphones.SOUND: The clarity and quality of sound these earbuds produce is remarkable. It's not quite on the level of the Bose overall, but I never expected it to be on account of these being earbuds and less than half the price.However, the bass that these earbuds pump out is what really blew me away on first use! The Bose headphones are actually a bit weak on bass, whereas these earbuds provide an impressive thump without distorting or sacrificing clarity across the rest of the frequency range. I'm not saying they have good bass *for ear buds,* I'm saying they pump out the bass, *period.*For reference, this is based on listening to EDM tracks from Pretty Lights and Tycho.COMFORT: They're buds, which are understandably less comfortable for a lot of folks than on-ear or over-ear headphones. But for earbuds, they are quite comfy.The rubber pieces that actually go in your ear are soft and pliable, and they come with FIVE different sizes of those. They fit snugly without feeling like they're stretching my ear canal.I haven't done any running or other major activity with them, but I've never felt at risk of one falling out while just walking around my office.NOISE ISOLATION/CANCELATION: This is actually the first set of noise canceling headphones/earbuds I've ever owned, so I can't compare that functionality to anything else, but I will say this: My office runs white noise machines all the time. When these connect to my phone and the noise cancellation begins, the drone from those machines (which I don't even realize I notice beforehand) suddenly goes completely silent.They also effectively reduce the sound of co-workers talking nearby--not completely, but far more than just putting plugs in my ears would do. (Speaking of noise isolation--just blocking sound by plugging your ears--these do more than any earbuds I've previously owned.)Finally, the different modes of noise cancellation that can be set through the app (more on that shortly) seem reasonably effective, but I haven't put them to the test in a variety of environments yet.BATTERY LIFE: I don't remember this being stated in the description, maybe because it's a given for wireless earbuds nowadays, but the carrying case functions as a power bank for these babies.I don't know how many times the case will charge the earbuds before needing to be recharged itself because I haven't drained it yet (in two weeks of using them every other day for 2-3 hours per day). When that time comes, I think it's neat that the case can charge wirelessly.It also has a microUSB charging port and comes with a cable, the other end of which is standard USB. Nothing comes with wall bricks anymore, but I guess they figure everyone has a few spare ones around by now.TECHNOLOGY: My first thought on being able to access some of the settings/features of these earbuds only through the app was, ""UGH, another product-specific app?! *grump*"" BUT, this app is remarkably sleek and easy to use. And I say that as someone who works for a software company.Setting the noise cancellation mode and customizing the on-board controls (what happens when you tap the earbuds in different ways during use) is very easy to do. The app also has a sound test feature to help make sure you're wearing the earbuds correctly and have the right size squishy ear piece on them.After initially pairing them with my phone via Bluetooth, the connectivity has worked flawlessly. When I remove them from the case, they connect right away. When I put them back in and close the case, they are disconnected. Every time. No fiddling with settings or having to re-pair.That consistent reliability is very nice, especially for phone calls. If the buds are in my ears, that's where the call comes in. If they're in the case, it comes through the phone speaker. No juggling devices or frantically pressing buttons to sort out where the sound will come out of next. The calls are clear, and the built-in microphones must pick up my voice well enough because I've had no complaints from anyone on the other end.I haven't tested the Bluetooth range on them because my phone is always on me when I'm using them.CONSTRUCTION: Solid build, clear attention to detail. The earbuds pop into the case with a satisfying little snap.The magnet that holds them in is very secure, so even with the case open I'm not worried about them falling out, but not so strong that they're difficult to remove.The case itself is terrifically compact and sturdy. The lid shuts securely, and would clearly protect the earbuds while bouncing around in a purse or backpack all day.SUMMARY: These are great earbuds. For the price, they're amazing earbuds. I know the technology is always advancing, but these do SO MUCH for $70, and they do all of it remarkably well. I've been going out of my way to recommend them to people, which is why I've written this novel of a review. If you've read this far, I certainly hope you've found it helpful. :)","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2022",AE32IG42QNFSNTCIBWQBOOSMU6PA,1,327,Color: Black,"November 5, 2022",2022-11-05,2022-11,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R3W4U2A2AS5ZWU,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars If you're looking for an excellent quality earbud that covers all the bases then you've found it!,LYCollins,5.0,"I have tried countless brands and styles of over-the-ear headphones, wired earbuds, wireless earbuds, and all the in between. I need something that works at the gym, on airplanes, while gardening, washing dishes, and driving. The Soundcore Life P3 is the first I've found that can do it ALL.The active noise cancellation is superb, and you can control it via the app or just by touch of the earbuds. I've had other earbuds that say they cancel noise but they don't even come close to these.The range of connection while listening to music, etc. all over my house (inside and outside) is important for me. I don't always bring my phone when I am going around the house, garage, yard, and these stay connected at least 90% of the locations i roam to at the edges of my yards--through closed doors.The quality of connection while in conversation is excellent, no complaints. The water resistance holds up to the IPX5 standard which is just what i need due to sweat & sometimes I (carefully) wash my face with them in.The battery life is excellent. They last a few days without needing to be plugged back into an outlet. The earbuds recharge in 10-15 minutes with the portable charging case. The charging case is even something to rave about! It is small and soft to the touch yet sturdy & durable. I do wish the magnetic closure was a little stronger but that is only because i often drop things & if you drop the case then the earbuds pop out (half the time). But I can honestly say that is my only complaint about these earbuds.I realize I sound like a paid advertisement but I am not - I just LOVE these earbuds. The quality is fantastic, and I think the price is just right: a little expensive but completely worth it.The customer service is the cherry on top! After a couple months of heavy use I had a fluke problem with one earbud and the customer service resolved the issue 100%. They did make me do some extra troubleshooting that was a little painful, and it did resolve the issue for a little while. After that earbud stopped working again I contacted customer service and they could not have been easier or quicker to completely rectify the situation. I am now even more fanatical about this brand.If you're looking for an excellent quality earbud that covers all the bases then you've found it--buy these.It is almost 3 years since I first purchased these & I stand by them 100%. They have taken countless drops, been stepped on a few times, sustained water submersion and still give amazing quality of sound, noise cancellation, and battery life. I have been getting comments about the mic quality on phone calls lately so I will soon replace them as i often use them for work. I will replace them with a new pair of Soundcores!","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2022",AENEP4XMMU5V3DHYS522PP5FIDGA,1,7,Color: Coral Red,"May 21, 2022",2022-05-21,2022-05,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R1PXZ3RO471MZU,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Unexpectedly satisfied! Sound quality, battery life, accessibility all great.",Naglfarslayer,4.0,"UPDATE (3 October 2022):After less than a year of a typical life (no major damage), each earbud has alternated between working and not working over the last month. For the first two weeks, the left earbud was silent, then it suddenly came back to life and the right one went silent within a couple of days and remains so today. Both headphones finally failed during a Zoom meeting this morning and have not yet been resurrected.While these have been excellent headphones, I am disappointed to experience a serious failure like this after LESS THAN ONE YEAR of responsible use and care.These were everything I wanted in new, EXPENSIVE (>$30) headphones.TL;DR: Great sound range (incl. prominent bass), satisfactory battery life (3-4 hours per charge; case gives ~2-3 recharges), and easy accessibility (two-step connection to device; the SoundCore app has a good widget). They are acceptable for voice calls, however they seem to pick up a lot of ambient background noise (papers shuffling, keyboard clicking, etc.), and my callers say the sound quality is better on my iPhone SE 2020 without the headphones, than with them.ONLY COMPLAINTS: very rarely but consistently, the sound will cut out for ~2 seconds before coming back - I believe this occurs when too many other wireless devices are nearby, as it has not happened at all the past 2 hours I've sat here at my work desk after-hours, but it happens every 1-2 minutes in the gym around many people wearing wireless headphones - CONSULT OTHER REVIEWS to see what the consensus is; I'm used to it by now - it's not a surprise and I miss very little in that small 1-2 sec window.NOTE that in-ear headphones naturally block out a lot of sound; 'Transparency Mode' helps to artificially add back in some environmental noise, but it is difficult to reliably hear people talk nearby.OVERALL: I'm very satisfied with the Anker Life P3. The sound quality is very nice (for a normie lol), the battery stays alive for several hours and charges quickly when returned to the case, and it easily pairs with Bluetooth devices.The origin story:I was reluctant to switch to wireless headphones due to the high prices and ease of losing track of them. I had to switch due to upgrading phones (iPhone SE to iPhone SE 2020, can't you tell I'm a cheapskate lol), and exhaustively researched wireless headphones to find a budget-end pair that still boasted good quality.My priorities were something reliable that would survive through long days in the (chemistry) lab, and during workouts (generic 30-45 min weightlifting or cardio). Many reviews recommended the Anker Life P3 as a solid entry on the lower-mid price range, although AirPods tended to remain the gold standard albeit at a notably higher price. Due to the consistent recommendation between reviewers (website and YouTube), I decided to go for it.The Anker Life P3 met my purchasing goals to a T (and I ride Boston's T system now, so I would know!).FIT: The fit feels nice, and the multiple pairs of rubber ear adapters give a chance for all ear sizes to feel comfortable. They don't fall out easily even when I run (both on the treadmill and *real* running), and they feel secure as I walk around. Minor irritation when my ears decide the 'foreign objects' need to leave, although this is rare.SOUND: I've listened to songs I've played for most of my life, and these earphones have brought out parts of the arrangement I have NEVER heard before. The bass is strong, so the full range of sound is there (no 'weak' or 'high' headphone sound here). In my opinion, the sound is powerful but balanced. Equalizers can probably tweak the sound if you prefer a different mix, but these bad boys can sure thump if you want them to!BATTERY: I usually give up before these headphones do. My typically listening sessions go between 30 min to 3 h and I've never had the batteries die on me. They *feel* like they quickly recharge when returned to the case, which provides another 2-3 full charges. The case can be separately recharged using the USB-C to USB-A cable provided; this takes longer, so charge the case overnight and it will keep the headphones charged for the entirety of the next day. Hardcore music marathoners may be less enthused by the battery life, but the Anker Life P3 has a longer lifespan than me!ACCESSIBILITY: I find the Life P3 to be easy to handle, although the initial linking was a bit confusing (and I already forgot how I did it!). When the headphone case is open, the three front lights turn/stay on for a few seconds. Then, the lights ignite in an alternating pattern, which is when the headphones are seeking a Bluetooth partner. On a device that knows the headphones, clicking on 'Soundcore Life P3' on the Bluetooth list will initiate the pairing, and then you're ready to go! To disconnect, you can remove it from the device, turn off the device Bluetooth, or return the headphones to the case and close the case. Unpaired headphones can be immediately paired with another device without having to be returned to the case. Re-cased headphones will immediately pause music/video streaming on the paired device (on Apple products, in my experience). The 'Soundcore' app for phones (haven't seen it for Mac) is very useful, as it provides some EQ's and the Noise Cancellation or Transparency modes. It also provides a widget for quick access to the Cancellation/Transparency/Normal modes for convenient toggling without having to open the app.Note: The headphone stems have two or three swipe features. I use these sparingly and have not investigated them further. One gesture skips to the next audio (song skip or 'next YouTube video in queue') which is convenient when desired; sometimes it takes me several attempts to gesture in a way the headphones will recognize, but more practice will likely help that.OTHER: As with all in-ear headphones, these naturally block a good 70% of external noise, and loud music will take out another 10-15% on top of that. It is near-impossible to hear people speaking to me with these headphones in; at most I get an inaudible, deep rumble that tells me someone is trying to speak to me. This is fine if you're prepared for it, but it is inconvenient to remove one headphone every time someone speaks to me - consider your intended use and how common this will be for you. The noise cancellation works very well, IMO, as only minor vibrations and deep sounds come through; I've experienced no intelligible talking in the background with that feature on, and bus/subway rides only have a deep hum characteristic of public transportation.ONE COMPLAINT: As mentioned in the TL;DR above, the sound does cut out for 1-2 seconds rarely, although this becomes more common in crowded ares with a higher density of wireless headphones. My hypothesis is that too much Bluetooth air traffic makes it difficult to stay connected to the signal, but I have no idea. This has only been a major issue in the gym, where the phenomenon seems frequent and consistent; I've only taken these to the gym two or three times, though. Check other reviews!OVERALL: I am quite satisfied with these headphones. $70 for exactly what I wanted? YES! When I inevitably drop one of the headphones down a storm drain, I will definitely look for another pair of Anker Life P3, or consider their other similar products.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2022",AHRON4BBXZLET3OZA2LRPMNSJ3ZA,1,233,Color: Black,"February 9, 2022",2022-02-09,2022-02,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

R3BBEJ31ICODZB,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars These buds are part of my life now.,Trucker Frank,5.0,"I absolutely love these ear buds!Comfort:I've never been a fan of ear buds in general because they've always hurt my ears but these don't. They are very comfortable and I can actually wear them for over an hour without them bothering me.Sound:The sound out of these little things is awesome! Loud, clear and full sound. Great bass which surprised me because I didn't expect it. Nice clear highs that don't sound like tin.Noise Cancelling:I've been using these in very noisy environments and they do extremely well. I work in trucking and my favorite place to use these is in the yard truck at the terminal while moving trailers around. It's an old beat up terminal tractor that just makes a ton of noise and clanks, bangs, shakes, and in general just a loud annoying place to be. These ear buds bring all that noise to a slight hum. With the music at half volume you barely hear the noise at all. Also did an excellent job at keeping things quiet while running the snow blower on my driveway.Transparency Mode:This feature works as expected. Not sure what else to say about it really lol. If I keep the music at a quarter volume I can hold a conversation with people even in a warehouse environment without feeling like I have to shout over the music or guess what they're trying to tell me. They also have a vocal mode in the software which actually makes some voices clearer when the person is at a distance and standing next to a noisy truck.Phone calls:They sound great and the caller can hear me perfectly too! I was blown away by this because going back to the terminal tractor I was talking about in the noise cancelling part of this review it's noisy... But the caller and I can clearly hold a conversation and it sounds great on both sides of the call. On a side note, the call sounds and goes smoothly even with a winter beeny hat over them WHILE DRIVING that insanely noisy truck!Battery life:The battery life has been great for my use case. I don't really wear them for very long in one shot like other people might. But, I've never had them go low on me and I've been on the same charge for the past 3 weeks with using them about 2 to 3 hours a day 5 days out of the week and I pretty much exclusively use noise cancelling or transparency modes. With that in mind when I put them back in the case I still get the 3 lights for state of charge.The Case:THANK YOU ANKER for pretty much having USB-C on everything you guys make and not putting Micro B on the lower cost products! Seriously, I really appreciate that. The case itself is great too. The ear buds snap in nice and easy when putting them away without fumbling. The shape of it feels good in my inside coat pocket which I know is subjective but I can say it's definitely not an annoying thing to carry. The cover is a cover lol. It closes nice, doesn't flop open and doesn't feel flimsy. The 3 lights show battery state of charge and light up for bud engagement confirmation when placing a bud in the case which is nice.Bluetooth:Works fantastic as you'd expect out of a device these days. Paired instantly with my phone on the first try. Doesn't cut out or cause any fuss and it's not laggy.Cons:I really haven't found any. But if I really had to be picky... I wish the volume control was a swipe gesture instead of a tap. It would be nice if they told you battery percentage when you turn the buds on. And I wish I had a case for the case, which may sound silly but a clamshell zipper case would be nice to have just to keep them extra safe. Honestly, I love these things so much that I'd probably cry if anything happened to them lol.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2022",AH3522A3DKI4ERI334G4H5CTXSJA,1,57,Color: Navy Blue,"March 5, 2022",2022-03-05,2022-03,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

But before you let me tell you why I am rating them 3 stars. Let‚Äôs start with the pros of these earbuds shall we. Bluetooth (true wireless), water resistant, noise cancellation, good batter life, and the software (app I should say) is perfect for custom controls. Now what are cons, the noise canceling is slightly there, I‚Äôm outside working with machinery and the noise bleeds right through (even using the settings in the app to keep for noise canceling outdoor, indoor, and transport) even having the on transport still bleeds in noise. Lightly plug your ears with your fingers and yup you got the full effect. The loudness of these earbuds is non existent. I was using these earbuds while my dad was jamming on the radio. I didn‚Äôt even hear my song with the volume all the way up with the highest noise canceling settings. Like I said they are great but not for everyone. If you never had noise canceling headphones or earbuds before. I highly recommend these so you can get started.

App: The app is very intuitive, and in addition to the equalizer, includes controls for ambient sound (noise cancellation), gaming mode, tip fit test, etc.. It also shows you how to set up the buds right out of the box. and allows you to customize the tap settings, etc. I haven't used it for phone calls, but some reviewers say they work well.3. Charging: You can use a USB cable or a wireless charging pad to charge it.Cons:1. User manual: The included manual is useless. It's printed in tiny light blue font on white (Why? Why? Oh Why?). I downloaded the pdf version of the manual and had to blow it up to read it.The good news is that you can ditch the manual and use the app, which explains everything you need.2. Ear Tips: It includes several size ear-tips, but as other reviewers noted, they don't do a good job of securing the buds. Fortunately I had a set of ""LUDOS Comfy Earbuds Replacement Memory Foam Ear Tips"" (Available on Amazon). These come in several sizes and colors including dayglow (makes finding the buds easier). They work perfectly.3. Noise cancellation: The app allows you to select different cancellation modes. Although noise-cancellation is not perfect, it's good for most environments.Final notes: These are not on a league with $200.00 plus earbuds, but if you are on a budget, you get a lot of bang for the buck at $70.00.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGNBGS4QA2RI5FO2QNVRNYVHW26A,1,5,Color: Oat White,"June 3, 2024",2024-06-03,2024-06,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R1QYXYTK0TIXIJ,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent warranty and customer service,ImmaDad,5.0,"About a year with my Life P3 and the left earbud gave up the ghost. Looking back at the last few weeks I think there were signs that I wrote off as little glitches. Things like the mic not working until I reconnected and the audio balance between left and right earbuds being very noticeable.Then last week the left ear just stopped working. I did all the things suggested on the site (cleaning the connections with rubbing alcohol, delete and resetup connection, making sure it‚Äôs fully charged, etc etc etc.) but no luck.Poking around the Soundcore site I see that the earbuds are covered under an 18 month warranty so a few hours after filling out their online form I receive the first of 3 emails advising that I do all the things I did already to see if that would get the earbud to work. As annoying as that is, I get they need to make sure customers are putting in the effort.I respond back letting them know I did each of the troubleshooting suggestions but apparently I wasn‚Äôt clear enough about the rubbing alcohol cleaning because I received the 2nd of my 3 emails stating I need to make sure the connecting points are cleaned which I responded back more carefully this time, making sure to include keywords so the bots know I did my part. The following day I get the 3rd and final email apologizing for the issue and telling me that I should expect a new pair of replacement buds to come out to me in about a week's time.I took that turnaround time with a grain of salt and assumed I would probably see it in a month since I wasn‚Äôt sure where it was coming from and how quickly they would have it in a box.2 days later, I come home and there‚Äôs a box at my door. just 2 days and I have my new earbuds. I am so impressed by their turnaround that I‚Äôm willing to overlook the robo emails I had to go through before getting to this part.I am really impressed by their customer service and have another reason to want to continue to be an Anker customer.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEBDM5LJPHTASBUTRXQWS56IB3TQ,1,1,Color: Black,"June 8, 2024",2024-06-08,2024-06,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
RHZIA9ZSQ6PPW,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Value,jdan318,5.0,"About 2 years ago I bought a pair of these, but recently lost them. I thought of getting a more expensive pair to replace them, but decided these did well enough before. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I am a musician, often mix live sound, and have owned many different pairs of decent open-backed and IEM headphones over the years, so I have some experience with sound quality.The sound quality on this new pair seems near identical to the old ones, which is good for music and videos, but both the battery and noise cancelation is noticeably improved on this newer pair. I would have been happy with an identical product, but the improvements make me very glad I didn't spend money on more expensive wireless earbuds, as these are more than decent, they are good, and for the money I dare say they are great.Update: Went on my first flight, so can give a more comprehensive review on the noise canceling. For cars I've been a passenger in, it eliminates road noise to the point I can't hear it. For a 737 when I'm in a window seat right behind the engine, it eliminates a lot of noise, but it certainly is still there. Still, turning it off then on again showcased that it still was bringing it down a ton, but these are not complete elimination (like I've read the Bose are).Still, while these are great at eliminating road, engine, and wind noise, what they do almost nothing for is voices. They do fit flush in my ear and create a seal, which does an okay job of bringing down talking and crying, but I still clearly heard babies crying during the flights. In the airport terminal, the indoor mode did lower the din of many people talking, but anything remotely close where you could listen to what they are saying still comes through. It does something, and for the price still is fine, but don't expect anything close to silence when surrounded by people talking.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEI62QY4IKCSR6XXPL3GY5ZONRYA,1,1,Color: Navy Blue,"June 8, 2024",2024-06-08,2024-06,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

I ordered these for around $65 and was so glad to see I could custom equalize them and save my custom EQ's (need to have a Soundcore login). They sound great and I can clearly hear the detail in the mids and highs. Just got them, so don't know yet about battery life, ANR, etc., but I got them for the sound.I had a lot of trouble pairing them, but it turns out Bluetooth was trying to recognize my old pair of Anker Soundcore earbuds, which showed up on my Bluetooth scan, and getting confused. I went to Bluetooth settings and ""forgot"" the older earbuds, rebooted everything including the phone, earbuds, Bluetooth, and Soundcore app, and the new earbuds showed up on my Bluetooth scan and I was able to connect easily.

I got them marked down to $55 (they were 13% off and there was a 20% coupon available as well).Before getting these, I was using AirPod Pros but they ended up getting water damage and I would need to pay near full price to get them replaced (original price $250). Unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt really in the budget, so I started looking for alternatives.First, sound quality is pretty great! There‚Äôs an app where you can adjust the sound settings as well. They have a noise cancelling, transparency, and normal mode just like AirPods do, and there‚Äôs an equalizer available if you‚Äôre someone who likes to adjust things more specifically to your tastes.Second, they pair to my phone pretty easily. I was worried the process would feel clunky since AirPods connect with no effort to Apple products, but once you pair them initially, they connect seamlessly.They fit really well due to the four silicone ear piece size options. I have small ears and the XS tips fit perfectly.Overall super happy with these!

RGE218DGT8WNG,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Calls; Lacking 2 Features,silverado98_nighthawk84,4.0,"This is now my third pair of earbuds. Comparing this to my previous ones (Earfun Air Pro 3, Earfun Air Pro), these Soundcore Life P3 knock it out of the park when it comes to background noise isolation in calls. Absolute night and day difference. I did a test in a noisy room (fan/air noise from a large HVAC unit) and these were so much clearer. The background noise was almost non-existent. I bought these primarily based on reviews of excellent call quality, and so far that has been true. I'll be testing more with phone calls as time goes on. As far as sound goes when listening to music, the quality seems top-notch, especially for the price point (I was able to snag these on sale). Personal preference, but I like the Soundcore Signature equalizer setting. It also has a BassUp option that I like as well. Upon opening the case, they pair very quickly with my phone.So far, my only dislikes/gripes with these are: 1) lack of ear/proximity detection and 2) lack of multi-device (multipoint) connection. With today's bluetooth technology, I don't understand why the multi-device connection is missing. My Earfun Air Pro has it and I didn't pay any more for them than I did these. (Earfun Air Pro 3 also lack this feature.) I can and will live without the ear detection, but having to constantly disconnect and reconnect between my phone and computer is going to be an annoyance more than anything. Had these Soundcore Life P3 included this, I would have given them five stars, even without the ear detection.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AFILWMLMEEVRAD4OAQJ2T6XSBIFA,1,0,Color: Black,"May 6, 2024",2024-05-06,2024-05,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

Literally took less than one min to connect to my device and set up the app.I literally don‚Äôt have any complaints. I don‚Äôt use them everyday so standby time was important for me and literally weeks went by before I had to charge my headphones. If you use them a lot of course don‚Äôt expect the battery to last that long. But still the battery life is pretty good on these.

The earbuds themselves fit my small ears quite nicely, and it comes with a set of different sizes of ear piece (S to XL). I like that you can change the noise cancellation settings and customize the EQ. It also has a ton of EQ presets tailored for different types of music (haven‚Äôt tried them out yet but seems pretty extensive).My favorite part is that you can customize the touch settings (see last photo)!! I actually didn‚Äôt realize you could when I bought them, didn‚Äôt know about the feature until I set them up. Each earbud can have different settings, too.I‚Äôve always hated the touch play/pause feature on my other earbuds because when I need to brush my hair behind my ear and accidentally brush the button and it pauses my music, and can‚Äôt wear earbuds under winter hats because the movement of the fabric makes it play/pause. Now, I am able to turn off all single-touch functions, and instead have the long touch as play/pause.These also have a great Bluetooth range. I like to have my earbuds connected to my laptop and ‚Äúwatch‚Äù Netflix while I‚Äôm cleaning the house, and I can leave my laptop in the kitchen while walking all over the house (several floors in a funky split-level), including into the garage and out to the dumpster, without the sound cutting out.

I used $300 JBLs that turned out to be crap so I just threw those away after using these. The only arguably bad thing I have to say is that you don't have a ""one touch"" operation when you only have one of them in your ear. You only have the ""double touch"" or ""2sec hold"" option but that definitely doesn't break it for me, especially for the price.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AGKTFF6ZFNRPCZO5MYFMPMUF4QXQ,1,0,Color: Navy Blue,"June 13, 2024",2024-06-13,2024-06,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R3LM0FUS1XHSRB,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Updated to 4 Stars Based on Customer Service/Fixes for several issues,James,4.0,"Leaving my original review below but changing my review to 4 stars based on the customer service. I reached out to Anker about my issues below and their CSR was very responsive. She walked me through a number of steps and when resets, etc. did not fix the connection problems, she gave me a RMA and shipped me a new unit as well as some foam eartips. The foam tips did WONDERS. I am surprised that they do not include them as an option in the box from the get go (maybe people like me are a very small minority) but they worked really well in keeping the buds in place. They will still come out in extended use (still waiting on a spirit x version of these) but I definitely don't have the same fear that they will fall out at an inopportune time. I still have a few connection issues from time to time and the lack of physical buttons can often be rage inducing so I'm not giving these 5 stars but they are a really good value for the money and from a company that stands behind their product.Original review below:Anker has provided so much value to me over the years (to date, I've bought the soundcore life 2, life q20, spirit X, curve, and an untold amount of cables :D) and I want to love these earbuds so much. There's so much promise and so many features but the sum of it all falls short for me.First off, they look great - as soon as I bought them (my first set of wireless earbuds), people in my office were asking what they were because they looked really sharp. When I am sitting down at my desk and have both of these in, they are really good at blocking out exterior noise which is why I bought them (I work in a refashioned warehouse and the HVAC system and the industrial refrigerators we have create a ton of looping, irritating noise). The ANC is pretty solid for my needs and the sound quality for the podcasts I listen to seems really good.However, the problems arise when I am not using them in that ideal scenario (seated, both buds in). When I have one bud in, the touch controls don't seem to work as well and I have to try a few times for the command to register, if it does at all. This might be a minor quibble as I'm not sure how many people are going into ""mono"" mode but since it is most of my day, it can make the headphones borderline unusable for me. In the same vein, I do like the app (Android) but I hate the widget - whenever I flip to it to switch the hearing modes, it never says the buds are connected...even though they are in my ear and playing music. It defeats the purpose of using a widget because I then have to unlock my phone and do it through the app. Now, I wouldn't have to do it through the app ... if the touch controls worked properly when I had one bud in. It's a cycle of frustration!Finally, the biggest problem for me is that the buds simply do not stay in all the time. especially when I am walking. I have tried several of the covers that they provided in the box and while I get a good seal for listening, I can feel the bud start to slip out of my ear as I am walking. I start panicking that it's going to fall and slam on the stamped concrete floors of the office and I'm going to be out the money I paid for these. If Anker made a spirit X version of these that hooked above the ear, that might be a better choice for me. For now, because of the above frustrations, these have been relegated to just at home use for my wife and I when we are not being active and can have both buds in.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2021",AHUK67NI4JQRYVD3RJ6YLQEOC47Q,1,104,Color: Navy Blue,"July 17, 2021",2021-07-17,2021-07,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
RJCLBUNTY2E0X,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressive buds for the price,H. Fox,5.0,"I'm nothing close to being an audiophile, but I use earbuds and headphones of several different brands a lot, in and out of the house. As a 65+ senior with a mild but annoying tinnitus problem, I use my AirPods Pro every time I watch TV at home because, without them, it's very difficult to catch all of the dialogue of almost every program I watch. They sync with my LG TV very well so I don't have to adjust TV settings for video/audio syncing.But this is a review of the Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds, so why am I talking up the AirPods Pro? Simple. They make for a great comparison. I've owned earlier versions of the Anker Soundcore non-ANC buds that were less expensive, and it showed in their performance. But, I gotta say, the P3 ANCs are way, way better. I don't fly a lot, but recently, on some very long flights from Florida to western Canada, the P3s really shined. The constant noise level in most airliners is terrible and completely wears me out even after short flights. I was skeptical about using earbuds instead of headphones, but I literally couldn't believe my ears when I popped the P3s in and was instantly transformed by the quiet! Their noise canceling performance might not be the very best, but I've tried other brands including Sony, Sennheiser and Bowers-Wilkins and the P3s are truly nearly as good - including my AirPods Pro, which are my all-time favorites for both overall sound quality and ANC. The shocker, of course, is that the P3s are a fraction of the cost.To my problematic ears the sound quality of the P3s isn't quite there, but they are way more than just satisfactory. I would have given them four-and-a-half stars for that aspect, but Amazon won't let me. All around, the P3s are just plain awesome, and at their price point, they're amazing. Oh, and by the way, they work very well with my LG TV also. If I couldn't, or didn't want to, afford the AirPods Pro, the P3s would make me very happy as an alternative.Now for one quibble. The P3s charging case is just plain terrible. Not because they don't protect the buds or charge them properly, but because, in my experience, they're constantly popping open and dropping the P3s at the worst possible moments. The case is SO easy to accidently pop open, that if dropped a mere few inches onto a firm surface, mine would flop open and invariably the earbuds would just fall out. This made for some especially exciting moments on said airline trip to Canada. I nearly lost the P3s several times when they'd fall out of a pocket, or my backpack, and the case would pop open and scatter the buds in different directions. Just try finding two black earbuds on black carpet under your airline seat a couple times - not a pleasant experience. Heads up, Anker! I love a lot of your products, but you could do seriously better designing a case for such great earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2023",AEKYMROIZQIL46DMG3NJLQI6B6MQ,1,32,Color: Black,"August 22, 2023",2023-08-22,2023-08,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

The sound quality on these isn't quite as good as the Galaxy words nor is the noise cancellation but for the money, I didn't expect it to be.

R1F4CL31ULDQW1,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great for price, very strong bass (maybe too strong)",eqrweqe,4.0,"I revisited these after my Sony WF-1000XM4's started experiencing battery issues and the company wouldn't replace them.Putting them in is still a trick I'm learning to master. I still don't quite get the ""lock"" movement, but once they're in they stay in about as well as any other bud.For the price, the sound quality is essentially the same as the XM4's. Both earbuds needed some fussing with the EQ to get the best profile. The major difference is that while Sony lets you control the bass boost, this one goes full throttle. I had to heavily boost all the other frequencies in the EQ while reducing the lower frequencies to near zero (see screenshot for my recommendation) just to get it to a level I would consider acceptable. Some will like how ungodly strong it is, others will not.Noise canceling seems to be about on par with Sony, but the ambient sound is definitely much worse. The XM4's were clear as day whereas these still sound quite muffled. But the XM4's are a few bennies whereas this is 60 bucks, so you can't really complain too much.Touch controls are responsive, though you might get some accidental presses here and there. The only thing I wish these had was a sensor to automatically pause when you take the earbuds out, but I think I'll live.Bottom line, for 60 bucks these are really good earbuds that can compete with the best, with a few caveats here and there.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024",AG7A23DX5XH3NCQ3THOP3P2LEO5A,1,0,Color: Black,"February 13, 2024",2024-02-13,2024-02,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

RFD4WZ3MS8Y2O,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for price - with a catch,StephenH,4.0,"Briefly, I find these earbuds well worth the price and recommend them. My review is not a comparison of the product to others but the value of my purchase. * Noise cancellation is so-so overall. It's not ""true"" noise cancellation but rather smooths out ambient sounds. For example, the outdoor setting is reasonable for reducing wind noise but does not eliminate it. However, I do not find stark differences between the settings. The app has been updated since my purchase a couple months ago, and my initial experience with noise reduction was better before the update(s). Users can hope for Anker to do more tweaking to improve this feature.* Fit and finish is good. The case seems sturdy and would probably easily withstand a few drops. I like the tip selection and customizing them did improve my experience, although not as dramatically as perhaps advertised. I have slept with these earbuds with no negative consequence. The tap response is satisfactory although requiring something of a firm touch - some users may appreciate this while others might prefer a lighter touch.* The app is easy to navigate and the preset equalizer settings are numerous. The various settings are unique and have a qualitative impact on sound. This is not a situation where the user changes a setting and struggles to hear the difference. I have had no problem with the buds synching with my device or with each other (e.g., one earbud works but the other does not).* Sound quality is good and provides a good range of tones. I am a bit skeptical of the ""big bass,"" but again the setting does have an impact on sound. An audiophile should probably look elsewhere but sound quality will well satisfy most users.* The range - the distance between my device and the earbuds - is good. I am fortunate to live in a larger than average home and do not lose connection unless I am on the opposite end of the house from my device.* I have not used the wireless charging but have no reason to doubt the function. Otherwise, the battery appears to have a long-life; I have yet to experience running out of charge either with the earbuds themselves or with the case. I typically use these a few hours a day and charge the case every few weeks.* I reserve my opinion about using these earbuds on a phone call because I haven't taken a call. However, I have noticed that when my phone rings, the ringtone sounds tinny. This doesn't bode well for calls, although voices - such as audiobooks and podcasts - have a good sound.After two months of use, I recommend these earbuds and would likely buy them again (e.g., should I lose this pair). However, I paid $20 less than the current list price - a $60 purchase - and found it a very good deal. At $80, a consumer might shop a little more and possibly consider their device (Apple v. Android) and preference for better noise cancellation. Nonetheless, the average listener will be satisfied with the purchase even at the higher price point.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2022",AGIDTSAC6QLWO5LSJBIZ5CYRG6IA,1,3,Color: Black,"January 5, 2022",2022-01-05,2022-01,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R1H9WQM7P0JUI,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Incredible base, great noise cancellation, needs mute function",Scoobi_FreeBSD,4.0,"These are my 1st attempt at using an ear bud-style audio device since trying the wired bluetooth kind probably 5 years ago; those had an ear hook wrapped around my ear to hold them in. Other ear buds I've tried would not stay in my ears, so I've been using over-the-ear headphones.These ear buds fit my ears pretty well; the initial rubber cups that go into the ear seemed to fit pretty well; I tried 1 size up and 1 size down, actually went with 1 size up on the left ear. The buds work themselves out of my ears when I'm chewing (not sure if that's a common problem), but otherwise they stay in place fairly well when sitting at my desk (haven't tried them at the gym yet...guess I'll have to start going again).I read the reviews on the great bass response of these buds, they're all true! I was amazed at how realistic the bass was when listening to TV shows (e.g. the scene transition sound in The Big Bang Theory). Noise cancellation is also excellent; when I turn on noise cancellation with the TV on, it's almost like someone hit the mute button (of course it's not perfect and I can still hear the TV). Noise cancellation can be customized using the downloadable mobile app to cancel specific frequencies, or to pass through voice frequencies. Battery life is excellent, lasting at least 5 hours before the buds notify me with ""battery low"" every 5 minutes. One bud will konk out first and the other one several minutes later. I can use the buds with a fully-charged case for several days on a single case charge, using them a few (~2-4) hours per day. Microphones are good quality; I have not had any complaints from people I've been on calls with.The buds are controlled via capacitive touch actions on the main outer body of each bud. There are 3 actions one can perform on each bud - single tap, double tap and long press. Each action can be mapped to one of a number of actions - volume up, volume down, cycle through noise cancellation modes, initiate voice assistant (e.g. Alexa or Google Home), next track, previous track, play/pause. Single tap cannot do voice assistant, as of firmware version 02.61.The case is small, about the size of a plum. I've dropped the case with the ear buds in it a couple times, no noticeable damage, but the ear buds will fly everywhere.My only complaint is with the app and a missing ""mute"" function which can silence all audio from a paired Bluetooth device so I can hear what someone is saying. The app is reasonably user-friendly, and you essentially need it to change noise cancellation mode between all of the available modes (there's 6). Tap actions can only move you between the 3 categories - normal (off), transparency (allow certain frequencies) and noise cancellation. It would be nice if they added a mute/unmute tap action which turns off the audio I'm listening to.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AFJPI2IAJX2PMC2LL4NMSH5DCX5Q,1,2,Color: Navy Blue,"December 30, 2021",2021-12-30,2021-12,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

R2ZXJST4ARM093,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Deal for The Money.,Woody D.,4.0,"I am a former live sound engineer. To me sound quality is the number one concern. My last two sets of buds were actually sold as in ear monitors for professional musicians. One set were wired Sony's and the other Advanced AD3 wireless with a wire between the buds. Both had excellent sound quality. Since I have not had individual buds before and was afraid of losing one, I decided not to break the bank with my first pair. High end buds go for north of $200. I bought the P3s after doing quite a bit of research.When they arrived they were pretty easy to set up. The app you use with them is pretty simple. It includes a customizable EQ so you can tailor the sound to your liking. I use a ""dog eared"" setting boosting the bass and treble while leaving the midrange flat. The sound is really quite good.I would call the noise cancelling decent but not great. Of course in my opinion the only way you get great cancelling is with full headphones. You have a choice of different NC settings. I find the ""indoor"" setting works the best at the gym to somewhat drown out the music they are playing. I have not tried them on an airplane yet. As I mentioned I was afraid of losing a bud....so much that I leave them in until I get home and dump them in the charging case. When I leave the gym I just switch to the ""Ambient"" sound mode and I can hear the world around me pretty well. The buds work very well for phone calls. My wife says my voice sounds perfect when she calls.The controls on the buds for changing volume or tracks work ok, but are not perfect. At time I find myself just reaching for my phone to change track or adjust volume. That may be more about my gnarly fingers than the buds.I am still trying to get the pairing routine worked out. I have them paired with my phone, tablet and Peloton. I know they are supposed to pair automatically to the primary device, but I find I need to put them into pairing mode most of the time. Once paired they are rock solid....solid as in I left my phone on a machine at the gym, went to the other side of the building and they still worked.The buds fit well in my ears. I don't run, but a sweaty in the saddle, out of the saddle Peloton HIIT ride does not pop them out.The battery life seems good, but honestly I do not wear them more than a couple of hours and the rest of the time they live in their charging case.I would recommend these buds for people who want a pair of bud with good sound and don't want to break the bank to get it.

I really want to love these earbuds, but the audio keeps cutting out consistently when I use them. I‚Äôve unpaired them from my phone several times, and deleted the device from my phone with no improvement. I still enjoy these earbuds, but I assume they are a faulty set.*Original Review*I‚Äôve used these earbuds for almost 2 weeks and here‚Äôs my thoughts:1: Great value for the price.I preordered my pair and got a early bird discount code in my email for 20% off the day they launched. I paid around $65 when I purchased them, tax included.2: Very comfortable.These earbuds have a similar fit to AirPods Pro in the way they nestle on the outer edge of the ear canal. I wear the largest size ear tips and they fit securely. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúplug‚Äù your ears, but there‚Äôs a slight suction to keep them secure with minimal pressure.3: Sound quality is top tier under $100. Compared to AirPods Pro, there‚Äôs richer bass and clarity in my opinion. I achieved this by fiddling with the EQ on the Soundcore app. The default settings are fine, but the sound profile is much more nuanced and not as compressed when you customize it for your taste. I set mine to the R&B preset and customized it.4: Excellent battery life.On my days off I always have my earbuds in listening to YouTube, Apple Music, etc., and they exceeded my expectations. I only had to recharge once every 2-3 days in the time I‚Äôve had them. The case is fairly quick to charge and the earbuds themselves recharge fast after using them throughout the day.5: Noise cancellation is decent.The noise cancellation is detectable and can be very useful in certain environments, but don‚Äôt expect complete silence while using it. The different modes are useful, but I prefer to use the indoor mode the most. I estimate about a 50-60% noise reduction when I listen to my fridge running while using the noise cancellation.6: Instant pairing.When I get ready to use the earbuds, they pair with my phone before I get to put them in my ears. The pairing and connection range is very strong and consistent.I have some small criticisms too, starting with the audio playback.1: Audio can randomly go mute while playing media for 1-2 seconds at random times throughout the day. It happens maybe 3-5 times a day and isn‚Äôt intrusive, but can get annoying while you watch videos. I understand this is a new product and hopefully this will get fixed with firmware updates.2: Touch controls can be finicky (operator error)There‚Äôs a little learning curve to double tap consistently so the earbuds can recognize it. You have to tap near the very top of the earbud stem or it won‚Äôt work. It puts pressure into your ear when you tap and the video or music may not recognize it every time.All things considered, these earbuds are a great choice for anyone balling on a budget that wants quality and comfort for under $100.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2021",AEYPDC22S7GYSMNQB4PTDUYOZYOQ,1,3,Color: Navy Blue,"July 23, 2021",2021-07-23,2021-07,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R3NDNCKLZM1KJA,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great pair of PC headsets.,jesus,4.0,"So I did try to return these. Overall the sound quality is amazing and the sound isolation is not bad. While I'm used to airpods pro 2 and airpods max type of isolation. These are not bad.I mainly bought this as a replacement for my airpods pro 1 generations. As I lost them and find my was not picking up an active trace. I also use both android and iPhone so I wanted a device that essentially runs on both platforms.The case is good with strong magents to hold the ear pieces in. Good sound quality that I think most will enjoy and the features are not too bad.The only issue I had is when I was using them on my phone there was a type of glitch where sound just goes to 100% and I have to click the volume to go back to where it was. What I Mean by this is that let's say I'm watching a video or listen to music at 30% volume. Out of nowhere the audio sounds like it went to 100% which in turn hurts my ears. I then scramble to lower the volume but with one click it goes back to normal. So it wasn't really cranked up to 100% but audio did do that.With this in mind I was in the process with Amazon to return it but while I couldn't return them at the time I figured I'll hold on to them. I went and connected them to my PC and they auto connect and pair and audio plays beautifully. No hickups whatsoever. I think audio though I get more bass and voices like on a discord call while in gameplay is more closer and clear. So like fps games more roomy and bassy but the voice is contrast with clear and close. But overall they are great for PC use. I disabled the touch controls so they are a standalone Bluetooth earpiece that works seamlessly. Once you have put in the other ear in, you are already getting sound from the PC. This is great as while my overhear headsets charge, I use these and audio switches on there own.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2023",AFJZZ7GBHNX4QGHEIDLIXCPSXM5A,1,4,Color: Navy Blue,"July 16, 2023",2023-07-16,2023-07,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

ROCD5G6VV78AY,B093SLWMS7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Works, but not great.",Anon,3.0,"I got this because the price was okay and it's recommended as a cheap option for audiophiles. It's an okay product, but I really dislike that it doesn't have physical buttons to press when you want to start/pause something. I disabled the touch sense stuff through the app that it works with, and it seems to ignore the settings I have input. It will still start/pause stuff sometimes, even though the buttons are tied to anything. It also tries to launch ""bixby"", the mobile assistant thing for Samsung. I don't want to use it - I wish it would stop trying to start on its own.They also don't fit particularly well in the ear. They are okay enough that I can run with them in, but I do have to shove them back in, occasionally because it doesn't have a perfect seal around my ear, which causes them to start slipping after a while. I've tired the various rubber sized ear things that come with it, and none of them really worked any better.The battery life is fine. No complaints.They aren't horrible, but I wish they were priced lower.

The worst that happens is an occasional hiccup when connecting but putting them in the case and taking them out again sorts them out. Having an app to manage the eq is also great as someone who doesn't want a ton of bass.My main problem has been the quality of the case. The logo on it is just a thick plastic sticker that kept starting to peel off and jab me in the leg while in my pocket. I finally had to just remove it entirely, which only has the downsides of some glue residue and more of a gap where the sticker was.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AHIG2WHY4LGP75DKTMOO7RGYVT7Q,1,1,Color: Navy Blue,"March 22, 2024",2024-03-22,2024-03,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R20ISCQAWM5C1B,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones,Flashlight king,5.0,These headphones have performed excellent for me. Very good sound canceling. I really like the control in the app.What I really would like to add is these headphones are not ear protection. There is I believe a misconception about the difference between noise canceling and noise reducing. If you are mowing or using a blower etc. you need noise REDUCING. Noise cancelling is an artificial noise reduction. It does not protect your ears.I now use a 28db noise reduction over the ear earmuff with the Anker headphones underneath. This works great as I am getting really good noise reduction and still can listen to music. Only need the headphones about 1/3 volume to hear what I want to listen to. Please wear proper hearing protection.

R1LNCOKM441BMS,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these buds,Tmata,5.0,"I have tried too many pairs of earbuds, of too many brands, and after reading many many reviews. These are my absolute favorite pair of earbuds. I purchased a pair of these a year ago after reading a Wirecutter review for earbuds in the lower price range under $100. Amazon had them on a deal and they lived up to the reviews in sound, fit and quality. Then unfortunately I misplaced them. Long story short I unknowingly dropped them getting out my car, found them crushed a month later nearby by either my car or the snow plow, the price to replace was too much, and the hunt was on for new earbud replacements. I tried a few lesser from soundcore but they weren't P3s and a few other brands but they didn't have the sound or fit I enjoyed with the Life P3s. If you want earbuds to stay in your ears while eating, bending down, exercising, or just sitting with clear sound and listening to music like it's playing live in front of you, Life P3s are the buds. These were on a ""Deal"" again on Amazon and I didn't hesitate to reorder a new set and it's worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AH5U2AFL4OBYCKWXHYFZITVOGATA,1,0,Color: Coral Red,"March 17, 2024",2024-03-17,2024-03,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds
R1RXY2NUDI9XU9,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Battery Life is Amazing,Corey Helwig,4.0,"I‚Äôm going to compare these to the Apple AirPods Pro, because that‚Äôs what these are replacing for me.I enjoyed my AirPods. But the battery life started off not great, and over time, the earbuds developed some crackling. Finally decided to replace them and these earbuds are what I ordered.The last month or so I used the AirPods, I had to recharge the pack pretty much everyday. The earbuds would drain quickly, I‚Äôd put them back in the the charging case, and the entire charge would be gone within 24 hours.I received these exactly 1 month ago as I write this review. I use these earbuds the same amount I used my AirPods, and I‚Äôm only just now having to plug the case in to recharge it. It‚Äôs completely blown away all my expectations.The sound quality is also much better than the AirPods. The earpieces fit in more securely, and they are equally, if not slightly more comfortable than the AirPods were. I like a lot of bass with my music and these do not disappoint. All around real great quality product and way worth the money.My main criticism is that, compared to the AirPods, the transparency modes leave something to be desired. With the AirPods, I was able to have them in, and be able to hear people talking to me, if I needed to, with the music still playing. With these, I can hear someone‚Äôs voice if they‚Äôre talking to me, but I‚Äôd have to pause whatever I‚Äôm listening to in order to actually hear them. And even at that, the voices still sound muffled in all different transparency modes. So not a dealbreaker, but definitely a little bit of a pain in that regard.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AG6DAEYFKBXXPIPY743LLOZYNDCQ,1,14,Color: Black,"October 12, 2023",2023-10-12,2023-10,Philips,Philips Wireless Earbuds

I needed some noise canceling earbuds that would block the background noise without costing me $300. I‚Äôve previously had first gen AirPods and my hustband has the Bose quiet comfort so I had something to compare these to. I also bought a pair of noise canceling jbl earbuds as well as the anker liberty 4 so I could try out multiple and pick which ones I like best.These were the winner for multiple reasons! First off, I genuinely like the look of these over all others I tried (Bose included). The oat white looks expensive and is discrete. Secondly, these fit my ears the best. I have small ears apparently, and the jbls and my husbands Bose quiet comfort were too large and fell out if I turned my head. I found that the anker liberty 4s were slightly more bulky which is part of the reason I ultimately chose these. Thirdly, you can‚Äôt beat the price of these. I got a lightning deal that made these only $50. And finally, noise cancellation and sound quality are great! The liberty 4s and Bose block more noise but this was the right amount for me and I like that there are different modes.Highly recommend these!

My wife snores, and I needed some way to keep my marriage intact.Previously, I had a very old pair of Bose noise cancelling wired earbuds, but the battery died, and Bose is just too expensive. So I know what good noise cancelling is like, but I wanted something at a more reasonable price point.I was pleasantly surprised at the cancelling performance of the P3 earbuds, and the battery life in noise cancelling when you‚Äôre not playing music.Unfortunately, there is one problem.: the stock mushroom heads of the P3‚Äôs are utterly terrible. You need a good seal in your ear for the cancelling to work, and the design of the stock tips is poor. The various sizes don‚Äôt work for different reasons: either they are too small, or they deform in a way that doesn‚Äôt make a good seal. I think the engineers at Anker spent almost no time on the ergonomic design.Fortunately, though, I have many after market and leftover mushroom tips and I found one set that is‚Ä¶ well, better. I still have to keep pushing the earbuds back into my ear holes because they work loose, but I can live with that.Not that anyone will listen, but a future version of these buds should go a little deeper into your ear, and perhaps the rubber could be slightly higher density. Just as a side note, you can buy longer mushroom tips that work okay, but then the earbuds won‚Äôt fit in the charger.

These are a much better value and have no bugs.The things that I don‚Äôt like about these:There is a delay when you use the touch sensitive controls, which is just the section of the earbud with the logo. It‚Äôs not the stem. You press the logo and there‚Äôs a half second delay before it takes effect. When you have to double press it makes you wonder if it worked or not. There is a setting in the app to make an audible chime when you press a button. I enabled that and it helps a little.

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5.0,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn‚Äôt get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I‚Äôve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven‚Äôt tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button‚Äôs commands‚Äîwhile certainly vast‚Äîare greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It‚Äôs a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I‚Äôm sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I‚Äôve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it‚Äôs been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony‚Äôs music center app, and while it‚Äôs a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker‚Äôs functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money‚Äôs worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it‚Äôs a great edition to anyone‚Äôs outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I‚Äôm certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,1,17,Color: Off White,"June 24, 2024",2024-06-24,2024-06,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5.0,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,1,13,Color: Off White,"May 10, 2024",2024-05-10,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5.0,"This little speaker surprised me. This ‚ÄúULT‚Äù button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It‚Äôs fine if that‚Äôs all you want, but the equalization isn‚Äôt there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It‚Äôs pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn‚Äôt fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I‚Äôm glad I picked this one. It‚Äôs definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff.

R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5.0,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony‚Äôs music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,1,3,Color: Off White,"May 27, 2024",2024-05-27,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet. If I'm listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice, I can't hear clearly. Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth.

R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5.0,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,1,0,Color: Forest Gray,"July 20, 2024",2024-07-20,2024-07,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5.0,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try!

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5.0,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,1,227,Color: Black,"May 4, 2024",2024-05-04,2024-05,Sony,Sony Walkman Audio Player
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5.0,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,1,103,Color: Black,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Sony,Sony Walkman Audio Player

R3N5UYTNS8D2V6,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Small speaker, big sound, travel friendly",jonathan lopez,4.0,"Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me. Now let‚Äôs see if the battery life is legit.

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Caitriona Gillespie,5.0,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,1,19,Color: Chilled Lilac,"June 15, 2024",2024-06-15,2024-06,Sony,Sony Walkman Audio Player
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4.0,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,1,2,Color: Black,"July 22, 2024",2024-07-22,2024-07,Sony,Sony Walkman Audio Player

Solid buy!,Bruce C,5.0,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5.0,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,1,69,Color: Black,"April 5, 2024",2024-04-05,2024-04,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny.

I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,1,0,Color: Camouflage,"June 24, 2024",2024-06-24,2024-06,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5.0,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,1,156,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"October 1, 2022",2022-10-01,2022-10,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design.

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4.0,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,1,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"June 5, 2024",2024-06-05,2024-06,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R3FXXMYB4LCBKF,B07DD3WBYW,1.0 out of 5 stars The worst speaker every when used as two or more together,Charles Magnuson,1.0,"The media could not be loaded. I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers.When used as a single speaker, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well. The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size. The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker's audio source, but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault. The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions. Overall, the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself.The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together. I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,1,283,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker,"November 2, 2018",2018-11-02,2018-11,Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears Boom 3 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2.0,"üíóLet me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.üîçFinally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1Ô∏è‚É£üÜïFirst impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.‚ö†Ô∏èü™´THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. ü™´‚ö†Ô∏èüò°I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE üëéüò¢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.‚ö†Ô∏èDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY üí∏ BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ‚ö†Ô∏èSorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,1,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker,"November 17, 2022",2022-11-17,2022-11,Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears Boom 3 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Imagine my surprise when this small SoundLink Mini didn't even come close to the sound quality of the older variants.I still have my original Soundlink Mini II from years ago but the USB micro port was starting to show it's age. Even with new cables, it often struggled to recognize when the charging cable was attached, and I've since lost the charging baseplate.This new one feels similar in construction with the added bonus of a TYPE C USB port. However, once on and playing music (synthwave, oldies, alternative) the low ends sound hollow and completely washed out compared to the old Soundlink. We tried both side by side and the older model is MUCH sharper and sounds much clearer in the low as well as mid range.The new one doesn't even come with a complete charging system, just a TYPE A to TYPE C usb cable.Huge disappointment for fans of the days when BOSE was king of the sound hill.EDIT: Amending review to 1-star after keeping the device playing for several hours.

R2KX6SPZ5R6EHA,B07YBN9XXG,3.0 out of 5 stars Planned Obsolescence,NC Steve,3.0,"I loved this speaker. For such tiny speakers, it had amazing sound. Quality construction, well-integrated features and charger. We owned this for five years before trouble started.A little background: I'm an avid DIYer, and a retired electronics technician. I appreciate good sound quality but, being in my 60s and having played lots-o-loud music, I can say that my hearing isn't up to that of a thirtysomething but to my wife and I the sound was great for such a tiny speaker. Of course, it's not going to outperform a 100W receiver with a pair of bookshelf speakers but it's darned good.And I don't think that I'm being overly demanding for kvetching about something that gave me 5 years of use having come up short. My reasoning is that this speaker cost over $200 in a world that now contains competitive products for under $50.When the Li ion battery gives up the ghost, you can't run it on the charger. It won't turn on. Period. So I started looking for a replacement battery for it and thought everything was going to be fine. Unfortunately, Bose decided to change the superior design of their earlier soundlink battery to an inferior design. You see, the original Soundlink had a drop-in battery. Pull the rubber off the bottom, pull the battery out, drop in a new battery, tighten screws and replace bottom. Done.The Soundlink II has a battery that requires one to tear the whole speaker apart and solder the cable to the circuit board (or splice the cable). Yeah, I can do it but I've seen (and experienced) too many bad replacement batteries -- some of which I have purchased and installed. I can get a new replacement battery for around $40 and spend one or two hours doing the job -- or I can buy a very close equivalent for $40. I have enough electronics to repair here, so I'm taking the easy way out. I would have been more than willing to buy a drop-in battery but oh, well.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2022",AGANQOTNO673FH2GJGJSMG2JADZQ,0,25,Color: Luxe Silver,"July 4, 2022",2022-07-04,2022-07,Bose,Bose SoundLink Mini II Special Edition

The special edition is an older device isn't water proof, is heavy, and doesn't have USB charging ports for your phones. However if you want amazing sound get this speaker.Bose has set itself as the gold standard when it comes to well-built devices. I bought mine refurbished and my goodness the sound compared to all my other BT speakers was just a night and day difference. The clarity of the voices and the bass are unmatched. The device is surprising heavy for such a smaller speaker. I believe that's due to the heavier magnets for the speakers.Some have complained (and I agree) that the speakers are a bit on the bass-heavy side. I do understand it does cater to more of an R&B tuning with heavy bass. But with software EQ the bass can be trimmed out and the audio is perfect.The battery life is amazing. 2 full days of non-stop use and still have 50% battery life. We were painting the house and had this on blast for those 2 full days of 10 hour work sessions and on the 3rd day still have plenty of juice to keep going.It does support multiple devices connected to the speaker so my wife and I can share the speaker with our Spotify account and can even ""join"" a music session.Buy this speaker.

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5.0,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term.

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is.

There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5.0,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,1,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"March 29, 2023",2023-03-29,2023-03,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters ‚Äì B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker ‚Äì and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed. I'm a convert and already planning to surround myself with more of these pocket-sized wonders!Cheers,","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AEWYYN4J3I3I5IIF5QNOBAF4GYIQ,1,5,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"January 27, 2024",2024-01-27,2024-01,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Also, Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound, or in stereo, but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers. I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical.

I am not a real audiophile by any means, but I know quality when I hear it, and this falls seriously short. It sounds very muffled, and a lot of midrange and high frequency is lost in this awful dishwater of muffled sound. It‚Äôs reasonably loud for its size, but not very loud compared to better quality speakers of the same size. I have to wonder why so little of the whole device actually emits sound and why the other 80 percent is just rubber and plastic covering. All in all, it‚Äôs just kind of a piece of junk that looks like it could be nice.

R26NYYKTFM4AAF,B0B44F1GGK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful, great sound, good battery life, nice design",RedXepher82,5.0,"I really loved these bluetooth speakers as they are very durable, powerful clear sound, and look pretty nice. The first thing to note is that this is a wireless only device. It cannot be used with an aux cable so you need to use this via bluetooth. There is no real way to do a direct connected. That being said, if you are using a projector, you will need to be able to connect is via bluetooth. I have used it for my laptop via bluetooth it works great. The sound quality is really clear and has a pretty good base to it for the size. When it first arrived, the initial battery was around 50 percent. It lasted about four hours on just playing movie sounds alone from my laptop. Even with the bluetooth connection, it did not drain the battery too quickly. I charged it which took about three hours to get to full, but it all depends on what media you are using. When I charged it with my laptop, it took longer than it would with a wall plug or power hub. It does use a type c connector in order to charge the device. Afterwards, I tried pairing it via Bluetooth to my phone and the sound quality was amazing. There was no lag or static even from several feet away. The sound was crystal clear and had a good bass sound to it. The device itself isn't too heavy but it is a bit big so you are transporting it just know that. It will take a good amount of room in say your backpack. On Bluetooth from full charge I was able to use the speakers for several days on and off for 1 hour to 2 hours a day. The white color looks pretty nice and it is not as easy to see the scratches on the device. You do see it get visibly dirty and it is prone to sun damage. The material the device is made out of it is pretty sturdy but I wouldn't recommend dropping it. It is also not water resistant/proof so do not get it wet or you may damage the speakers. There is a really nice string hook that you can use to attach to your back pack or hang it. It is a really durable rope. Overall I think this is a great bluetooth speaker. It gives a good amount of range around 10-15 feet before losing any kind of sound quality and it last a pretty long time. It is definitely a must have if you like playing music on the go and it is a very durable speaker system. I do wish there was a way to connect it via wire but that is okay.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AF6RFVIK2MSSR3PQTKQKAVK4HNRQ,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,"June 2, 2023",2023-06-02,2023-06,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R3K1L360PPZ5YT,B0B44F1GGK,"4.0 out of 5 stars I have some issues, but for the most part I love it.",Rabbit,4.0,"For starters, I loathe Sony‚Äôs obsession with the proprietary, whether it be software, chargers, or special headphones that you have to have in order to properly use your own stuff. It drives me batty. This speaker, of course, wants to use Sony‚Äôs proprietary app for iPhone. It‚Äôs horrible. Skip it. It doesn‚Äôt do anything that Apple Music, Google Music, etc, can‚Äôt. In fact, I can do a lot more for my equalization with the iPhone‚Äôs inbuilt music app‚Äôs settings. It makes your phone‚Äôs battery drain faster, it doesn‚Äôt help with Bluetooth connectivity, it serves no purpose aside to inflate Sony‚Äôs proprietary status.Just utilize it like every other normal Bluetooth speaker. It has occasional hiccups and glitches in connection, which is weird, as I‚Äôve had super generic speakers that never have any issues whatsoever, but this little guy drops out for no reason for a few seconds at a time every so often. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. The app seems to make it worse somehow, maybe a latency in reading music files? I have no idea what‚Äôs happening there. It needs to be sorted, but that‚Äôs the only problem I‚Äôve had.That may seem like a big drawback, but to me it isn‚Äôt. The occurrence of such dropouts are rare enough that I can ignore it. The sound quality is fantastic, as is the maximum playable volume. The sound can fill a rather large room with high ceilings with no problem. That‚Äôs fantastic, as I live in an old house with very tall rooms and wide open doorways. The battery life is decent, as I can usually get a good six hours or so out of a single charge at maximum volume. The blue colour is gorgeous and I love the slimline speaker look. It is pretty durable and has taken a couple of big knocks from falling off of my kitchen counter. The silicone covering is soft to the touch and easy to wipe clean and it charges with USB-C, so no proprietary bull there. It has an auxiliary jack, so I can use my old iPod Classic without using a Bluetooth transmitter.Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I haven‚Äôt tested it‚Äôs water resistance yet, as I don‚Äôt really feel great about tossing my nice new things in a filled bathtub for funsies. So if you really want to find out how water resistant one of these bad boys is, be my guest, it‚Äôs your money. But I prefer not to find these things out the hard way, if you get my drift.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGQDJA57TXC7G6FZQP2GQY5VBAIQ,0,2,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,"September 29, 2022",2022-09-29,2022-09,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1BSI08ET2JUBA,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars A good rugged/waterproof speaker from Sony,Customer Review,4.0,"This Sony SRS-XE200 (Sony has the best product names, am I right?) is a tall cylindrical shape, but I don't think it has a 360 degree orientation like the old Amazon Echo speakers. This one fires out of the mesh on just one side, in one direction. If you have ever owned a pair of Sony earbuds or one of their sound bars, you will be familiar with their mobile apps. This one uses ""Music Center"" for changing any settings more advanced than changing the volume, this is also where you can update the firmware over bluetooth. This speaker supports Google Fast Pair, so if you have an Android smartphone, this makes pairing it super easy.The only negative thing about this speaker (from my perspective) is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack for using a wired connection. This is purely bluetooth, so make sure you are good with that. It has a built-in microphone for phone calls or summoning a digital assistant (Google Assistant/Siri/Alexa). It does have USB C port for charging, but you cannot plug it up to something like a laptop use it over USB. It has a rapid charging feature, 10 minutes plugged in will equal 70 minutes of playtime. The 16 hour battery life rating seems to be accurate in my testing, that assumes you would be listening at 50% volume (this is always the case for quoted battery life estimates).If you're curious about the drivers inside, as far as I can tell, it is just one full-range driver measuring:42mm x 51mm. But, I'm not 100% sure because on Sony's website, it shows a cutaway diagram that appears to have dual drivers. The default configuration in the app is mono, but this could be because the drivers are arranged vertically (if there are two of them).This speaker is ideal for taking places, it's designed to be very durable and it is IP67 water-resistant (assuming you keep the protective flap closed over the USB C port). If you need one to keep at home on a shelf, there are better options than this for the price, with better sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AH35XWTFCCK7DEATASGPXWVNSETQ,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,"December 18, 2022",2022-12-18,2022-12,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R224LNL344ZL4S,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound in a perfectly sized package,unrealtrip,5.0,"I use Bluetooth speakers every day, and because of that I have gone through many different ones narrowing things down to what for me is an optimal everyday speaker when it comes to size, functionality, sound quality, and toughness. Like many people these days I attend a lot of online meetings, so a good clear microphone and the ability to hear voice audio well is important. I also like to listen to music throughout the day while I work, so it needs to sound good in that regard as well. Toughness is certainly a factor for a portable speaker as the possibility of dropping it or having it get knocked down is very real. And finally, the physical size and form factor is critical as it needs to be easy to grab and move to another room to bring a meeting or music with me.This Sony speaker hits every item on my list and then some. It uses USB-C for charging, the port hidden behind a secure but easy to remove rubber panel. The buttons down the side are easy to hit, and the indicator lights are clear and make sense. The microphone is your fairly typical micro-sized hole, though it works well for voice calls. When it comes to using it as a speakerphone, I‚Äôm told by others that my voice sounds clear, and locally I find that the audio is loud and clear, and people‚Äôs voices sound natural. Music sounds very good and there is a companion mobile app which you can use to adjust the lows/mids/highs to some degree. In fact, the companion app has many other things you can adjust as well, and it isn‚Äôt simply a gimmick.I haven‚Äôt tested the toughness beyond one of my kids accidentally knocking it off a table, but it didn‚Äôt sound bad when it hit the floor, and the rubberized exterior seemed to do its job well at absorbing the impact. I like the tether it has, which is handy for grabbing it from to move it, and the shape of the speaker itself is also nice as it completely prevents it from rolling away. Sound is projected largely through the center, and it sounds good both standing up or on its side.Overall, I‚Äôve found this to be a near perfect speaker for my needs. I‚Äôve used it daily for almost a month now and I have no complaints whatsoever. The battery life is great, the sound for both music and audio calls is excellent, and the physical form factor works really well for a handy everyday speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AH55RDCKO4VFJSNTEGFNKMOHUBPQ,0,2,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,"September 22, 2022",2022-09-22,2022-09,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1G3SZE1QZVNVF,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars My new favorite portable speaker,Ernest Stalnaker,5.0,"The only portable speaker I used for a few years was an Ultimate Ears Boom 2, which I loved. It had great sound and was small enough take anywhere. But the battery finally died and it could not be charged anymore. Since it was out of warranty, I needed to get a new speaker. So I decided to give this new Sony XE200 a try. I have a few pairs of high-end Sony headphones and have always been impressed by the audio quality of their products. I chose the XE200 rather than the XE300 since it was the smallest model they sell in this line. It's a bit larger than my UE Boom 2 was, but it's still small enough to carry everywhere. Plus it has an integrated strap that makes it simple to carry, secure to my backpack, or hang on a hook wherever I happen to be at the time. The audio quality is absolutely amazing with this speaker! It is definitely better than my UE Boom 2, and I was very happy with how that one sounded. The range is better, probably because it has a newer version of Bluetooth. The battery life is better as well. Overall this is the perfect speaker for me. I can listen to high-quality audio wherever I go. It is also a great conference room speaker, thanks to the excellent microphone that is built in. If you need a small speaker that is portable but sounds just as good as much larger speakers, I don't think you'll find anything better than the Sony XE200.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AFKD6XBSKL6VCRHFPFIHZUCMIZFA,0,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE200,"September 20, 2022",2022-09-20,2022-09,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R2643Q0PAJQRTB,B0B44F1GGK,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great weather proofing, long battery life, okay sound.",What The Tech,4.0,"The media could not be loaded. What you should know: The Sony SRS-XE200 is a loud little speaker, but with no bass. Battery life is good, but you are really paying for the IP67 rating with this one.The Good: This speaker feels like a quality product. The outer rubber coating is soft to the touch and feels like it will last through the elements. The other materials used is a mesh webbing pattern that gives it some style and flare. The buttons on the side are simple and easy to understand. They feel good when you push them in. The included strap is awesome, Sony did not cheap out on the materials. It should hold up through many uses without fraying for a long time. The blue color way is very vibrant and just pops amongst so many other darker colored speakers. The setup is super easy, you don‚Äôt need to download the Sony app if you don‚Äôt want to. If you do download the app, you get some other sound features. The weight of this speaker seems to be light compared to some others in the category. You can just through this in your beach bag or backpack and not worry that it‚Äôs taking up too much room.The Bad: The sound quality is just okay. This does get loud to fill up a room in the house, but the bass is so tiny I wouldn‚Äôt recommend full volume.

The size is great, it is not super heavy, and it was easy for her to set up with her phone (which is a miracle).As for me, I think for the price at time of review and for it being Sony, I expected a bit more. The build quality is there for sure, but the sound quality is not so much. I have other similarly sized and priced speakers that sound significantly better than this.

R2Q75U03YDA1MT,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good,K. Taylor,4.0,"This is a standard workhorse speaker that offers the build and audio quality you'd expect from Sony. It's nothing particularly special, but as a Sony product it's dependable and will keep going for years without issues, I'm sure.I find that portable Bluetooth speakers can be a little hit and miss when it comes to audio quality, so I tend to steer clear of sub-$100 options. This one just about clears the bar of what I'd expect at this price point. Of course you're paying a little for the brand name, but the audio is good enough for use by the side of the pool. The bass is acceptable, and the mids are crisp enough to make this a good speaker for listening to audiobooks and podcasts.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022",AFT6V6RFEFVC7L4NVPFZS3CQ3MJA,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,"October 12, 2022",2022-10-12,2022-10,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I've listened to some baroque classical music and now I'm on Kanye West and enjoying it. These are great speakers. Big bass, warm and suprisingly full sound despite the small size. Volume isn't blasting, but it's much like other Bluetooth speakers of similar price and size I own--JBL, Ultimate Ears.Google Fast Pair works well. With an Android phone this speaker was immediately recognized, its picture displayed and paired with my phone without me having to open the settings at all.Speaker build quality is top notch. IP67 waterproofing means you can use it outdoors in the rain without worry.Adjust the equalization if you don't like the sound. I found a flat equalization sounds best to my ears. There's enough bass that you probably don't want to boost it if you're interested in a full sound spectrum.Works well as a speaker phone. Has the ability for you to mute the microphone if you're using it for phone calls.Overall, this is very much the kind of quality and sound you expect from Sony.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AFETC3OMUM4P4QGLIAHS4C7REIOQ,0,0,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,"September 20, 2022",2022-09-20,2022-09,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker
RCQ9O4KAUPVKO,B0B44F1GGK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Strong bass, great overall sound!",Eva Wu,5.0,"Speaker was a breeze to set up. Pulled it out of the box, charged it in a couple of hours, and establishing a connection with my phone and laptop was so easy. When I turn the speaker on now, it pairs automatically with my devices, and it verbalizes when it connects to a device. It can connect multiple devices at once, but I have only needed to connect two devices for my needs.The sound quality is excellent. At lower volumes, the bass is stronger than the rest. The middle to upper volume range has better overall balance. The speaker works best for music; even though it works for calls, there is a slight delay due to Bluetooth connectivity.The build feels durable. The plastic parts of made of a silicon-like material, which dust seems to stick to, unfortunately. It‚Äôs not difficult to wipe off though. The carrying strap is convenient, but overall, the size of the speaker is very portable and easy to hold.The 16-hour playing time will probably be affected by the number of devices connected and the volume you have it at. The battery life works well for me, and the USB-C charging is convenient because most other devices utilize USB-C.There are definitely cheaper speakers out there, but I would say this one is worth a shot.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2022",AGGWBBGDEUM7KFRRDEHIPROA3V7Q,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,"October 13, 2022",2022-10-13,2022-10,Sony,Sony SRS-XE200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker

First thing first, the features: being waterproof, dustproof and shock proof caught my attention as I was looking for a soeaker that I can take with me paddle boarding and kayaking! The ability to use it as a speaker for my phone while the phone is in a dry sack is also an essential feature for me getting this speaker. Then comes the sound! The design of the speaker able to be heard all the way around it so clearly is one of the best in this category. At first I wasn't sure if I should place it horizontally or vertically on the paddle board to get the best sound...but it actually didn't matter. Another feature that I like is the lanyard that's attached to it, its a heavy duty one! I was able to hang the speaker on my back pack while riding my mountain bike and it sounded like I have surround speakers on the trails ( not kidding!)...I got compliments from my fellow riders!Now, for the things I can say that should be better for this product? I can only say one thing-more low end!Overall, I can say that this speaker is one of the best in its category.

I have read several comments criticizing the quality of the sound. I have another speaker (portable as well) from Bose and must say that both are easily surpassed by a home theater or sound system.Why I love it then?

R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you‚Äôre an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint.

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3.0,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,1,20,Color: White,"December 15, 2023",2023-12-15,2023-12,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5.0,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,1,2,Color: Black,"February 19, 2024",2024-02-19,2024-02,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

I drew a few neighbors out of their houses to see where the party at, and it was just me listening to some quality sound that I didn't even imagine. So glad I chose it over the BOSE speaker, and it was on a great sale.

I like music when I‚Äôm working so sound quality is important to me. I‚Äôd say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks.

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4.0,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good.

But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 10, 2024",2024-07-10,2024-07,Bang & Olufsen,Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portable Speaker
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5.0,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 1, 2024",2024-07-01,2024-07,Bang & Olufsen,Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portable Speaker
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5.0,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,0,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 13, 2024",2024-07-13,2024-07,Bang & Olufsen,Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portable Speaker
R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5.0,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"June 30, 2024",2024-06-30,2024-06,Bang & Olufsen,Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portable Speaker

There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass.

It has a ‚Äúparty‚Äù setting also. I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely! I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot! It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker. Just follow the instructions provided! This was a great investment because I‚Äôm all about music üé∂ and good sound. I even listen to my podcasts using them. You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone, which is really convenient! Even if I‚Äôm talking on the phone and want the conversation heard, it can come across the speaker! The USB/C charger cord comes with it. It charges very quickly! I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to. These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had! But then‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a BOSE!!!! The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too. That‚Äôs especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants! I don‚Äôt have to worry about its stability, although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing! If you like what I described, you will want to own one or more!

This is decent. Even for my ears, which I am hard at hearing. It's a nice looking speaker. Not too heavy. I use it mostly in the kitchen while I cook. It's probably a 4/5 there is much better speakers in the market. But, not for that price. It is a mono speaker on the right and a Support speaker on its left.If I could have changed anything about the speaker.. I would design it to be stero speaker.

It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again?

I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

RARW9ZM6Q1LZT,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Super impressive sound in a small package!,Franco F,5.0,"After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments, I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2. I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose‚Äôs bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I‚Äôd recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won‚Äôt be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it‚Äôs no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,1,4,Color: Orange,"July 9, 2024",2024-07-09,2024-07,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5.0,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is‚Äîmaking it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5‚Äôs, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony‚Äôs engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it‚Äôs unleashing the Iron Giant, and I‚Äôm here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my ‚Äúconnected devices‚Äù widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12‚Äù Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AHILCRCS3JLKYKQ7KQEFRTO6ZMYA,1,1,Color: Orange,"May 28, 2024",2024-05-28,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5.0,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,1,2,Color: Orange,"May 13, 2024",2024-05-13,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

I just got this speaker and I‚Äôm writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it‚Äôs definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound. The to speakers that come in this one price is worth it buy it if you are thinking about it. No jack cable I don‚Äôt have anything that needs it so I‚Äôm good haha.

Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone.

In fact, the speaker tucks away nicely in my backpack's water bottle compartment and conveniently travels with me wherever I go; and because it is shockproof, water, dust and rust resistant, gets used in environments where I would normally think otherwise not to. Furthermore, the extra bass provided by the ULT toggle does a great job of creating a richer, fuller music experience. With all things being considered, this speaker's abundant features makes this my go-to portable speaker.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AH2PLG6YMPWSMKRJPWBATIBKM22Q,0,1,Color: Black,"July 8, 2024",2024-07-08,2024-07,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4.0,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,0,2,Color: Black,"May 8, 2024",2024-05-08,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
R3VJ6HBM3KLRK8,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4.0,"First I'd like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal. It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,0,3,Color: Off White,"June 1, 2024",2024-06-01,2024-06,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5.0,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,0,0,Color: Orange,"May 20, 2024",2024-05-20,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4.0,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,0,12,Color: Black,"May 7, 2024",2024-05-07,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

I am hopeful to sort this soon and I am sure if I contact the manufacturer I would get assistance, but eww phone calls.

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5.0,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,0,1,Color: Black,"May 15, 2024",2024-05-15,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

Whatever consumer electronics you buy, whether a TV, stereo or whatever, if it has the Sony label on it, you expect it to be good. That is part of the brand.This speaker delivers the quality you'd expect from Sony. I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok. This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features. But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated, with the Sony brand, you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good.

R3NFO7DBA3ZQJH,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, it sounds great. The bass does get deep.",J. Victor,5.0,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1. I was very disappointed with the ULT7, if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,0,5,Color: Orange,"May 11, 2024",2024-05-11,2024-05,Skullcandy,Skullcandy Wireless Earbuds

It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor, so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc. you may want to go with one of the other color options. I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don‚Äôt sound good enough to me bc I don‚Äôt get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn‚Äôt bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it‚Äôs nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds!

Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker.

It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product.

Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEKPQRCBV3DNLRZCMJSGQMSGSLAA,1,2,Color: Black,"July 27, 2024",2024-07-27,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

Numerous speakers around the house, Sonos Move for outdoors and decided to pick up a Roam for travel. The speaker sounds amazing, especially for its size... however I can't add it to the Sonos ecosystem. Its a lone item, but whats worse is my other speakers are also missing from the mobile app now. I'm not alone in this, but unfortunately Sonos doesn't seem to care about it.

RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6S748H,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4.0,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you‚Äôve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it‚Äôs okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don‚Äôt try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you‚Äôre pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I‚Äôm missing the mark on its intended use, but I don‚Äôt think so. For small sound and high portability, it‚Äôs okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I‚Äôll have to sample it for a while and along others. I‚Äôm on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I‚Äôll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it‚Äôs pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it‚Äôs been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it‚Äôs worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,1,9,Color: White,"July 8, 2024",2024-07-08,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

Using it as a laptop speaker... well bluetooth takes at least 2 full minutes to click on each morning I start my day, so when I join my first meeting, people are talking and I can't hear anything.

R150TBCEXTSQM4,B0CY6S748H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Nice speaker, decent sound",Dylan,4.0,"Overall, this speaker is good. I can see other speakers being better for the same price point, but here's a breakdown of what I have found after using it consistently for the past week or so:Connectivity - In the sense of range to connect, it is quite low. I have had multiple instances where I was using the speaker with bluetooth and it would start cutting out when I was 10+ feet away. On the other hand, you can also connect to this speaker through wifi which gives it great connectivity range.Ease of use - It is a pretty simple device with only 6 buttons (Play/Pause, volume up, volume down, voice activation, bluetooth, and power). No complaints here though I cannot speak for the voice feature as I have not used it yet.Sound quality - The sound quality is great for its size. If you are an audiophile, you have probably heard better speakers but for this size it is definitely above the standard.Battery Life - The battery life it pretty spotty and has been hard for me to understand. Sonos says it has 10 hour battery life off of full charge but I would probably say it is closer to 8.5-9 hrs from my use of it.Additional notes - The app is pretty annoying to use and can only be used when your device is connected to wifi. On the app you can control your music/audio you are playing and also balance the speakers treble and bass (something I have not been able to do off of wifi)","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AE775KVYVVC2ISN27P7OZDSY2SBQ,1,0,Color: Black,"July 30, 2024",2024-07-30,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

RUL2NHT5AJZTD,B01IOD7KB6,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed in almost every way - Don't buy!,Danny,2.0,"Attracted the successful marketing/branding pitch (""House of Marley"") and by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to purchase this speaker, despite its relatively high price in a product category with a huge number of high quality competitors. This was a mistake, and I am quite disappointed. Except for its look and styling, which I like very much (except for the exceptionally large and bulky size and weight, which I don't), there is nothing else that I like about this speaker:Sound quality - very tinny, almost unpleasant. I often listen to podcasts, and the default sound quality borders on unlistenable. I have to manipulate the equalizer settings on my phone app to be able to listen, and I have to do this every time. Very annoying. The situation is only slightly better when listening to music. Even my little first-generation Oontz Angle sounds better! In fact, my experience is at such odds with the reviews, that I wonder if I have a defective product.Size: I knew when I ordered that this was a larger system than most others in its quality and price range, but I guess I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, which are, for a ""portable"" system, huge and heavy. Maybe some people like this - not me. Much too big, much too heavy.Battery life - haven't measured it, but it is MUCH shorter than any other portable bluetooth speaker I have owned, and this was true right out of the box.Connection and operation: it works okay, but is annoyingly non-intuitive.Conclusion: poor sound quality, too big, short battery life, non-intuitive operation. There dozens of alternatives that will give you much better quality and satisfaction, for a lot less money. Stay away from the House of Marley, at least this particular product.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2018",AEJUHFEP7FRKBCAMWYULJID43ITA,1,3,Color: Signature Black,"April 30, 2018",2018-04-30,2018-04,House of Marley,House of Marley Get Together 2 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I‚Äôve also read pretty much every review on here, so I‚Äôll touch on some of the more frequent concerns.Sound quality: 1/5 very flat sounding with almost no bass and lackluster mids. Generally makes your music sound dull and lifeless. It does get fairly loud if you need it to, though. Acoustic music sounds alright, but that‚Äôs about it...Connections: 5/5 I‚Äôve had no issues with the Bluetooth or aux port on this. Never drops or cuts out from my apple or android devices. Sounds like QC is a bit problematic though, as lots of people have had issues in this department.Portability: 2/5 No covers for the speakers always makes me nervous when taking this anywhere. Just waiting for the day I get a pen through it or something. Battery adds a point though, because it has been reliable and lasts as long as advertised.Build: 4/5 Everything looks like it was put together well. Materials are nice. Good weight to it.Other: I am constantly annoyed that this doesn‚Äôt have a remote. I just want to turn it on and pair without getting up...","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2018",AFYB3LGAEKCS6ASTYBQFRKOTMAGQ,1,5,Color: Signature Black,"January 13, 2018",2018-01-13,2018-01,House of Marley,House of Marley Get Together 2 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

A remote or an over ride on this feature would be helpful. Five minutes of silence is all...don't get too comfortable, or take too much time to decide on what you want to listen to...five minutes....quick before it turns off...really annoying.

We saw this cool speaker, and both looked at each other and basically said, ""no way all this sound is coming from only this speaker!?"" And it was. I ordered one the next day. It's great, connects to BT on iPhone right away, range is on par with most better BT products, 30' +/-. Audio is very good for what it is, definitely above average. I also have a little Yamaha BT speaker (don't recall what model) and the Marley blows it away. I have heard some from JBL that sound good, the Marley is better.

R3GU79FPYHWZZI,B0CVFM97GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Quality!,Matt & Tracey,5.0,"I am beyond impressed with the Megaboom 4! I really love the sleek design, and the fact that it is portable. It's great for your home, throwing in your bag, going to the pool, or for outdoor activities. It is also awesome for the bathroom to listen to music while you shower since it is waterproof. I love the features of it being dust proof, waterproof, and drop proof! I like how you can be rough with it and it still works great! I don't intend to be rough with it, but I love that it's ready for any scenario. It also gives you the confidence that you really can bring it anywhere with you! Also I LOVE that it can float, so if you drop it in water it's not a goner. I had been kayaking a little while back and my boat tipped over along with everything that wasn't tied to the kayak. I had a different UE Boom that I got that wasn't waterproof nor able to float because I didn't want to pay the extra for it. I mean who loses their portable speaker in a lake?! Let's talk about the sound, it sounds amazing! The 360* sound feature is fantastic and it truly works! I played some music in my living room and you could hear it from every angle loud and clear! I could even clearly hear the music in the kitchen while doing dishes with the water running! The sound is crisp and makes music sound like you're at a concert! It's not overly bass-y, but it does have some good bass and I think it really adds to the listening experience. Did I say that the sound is amazing, and is so fun to use?! Out of all my portable and even non portable speakers this one is by far the best and the best sounding! The speaker can be turned up to a very loud volume where everyone in the house can hear it, which makes it perfect for the outdoors too! The volume range is great, if you want to crank it you can, or if you need to keep it at a more respectful level then that's an option too. It has a great battery life, it lasts almost all day on a single charge. I never seem to play music all day but it can last awhile on one charge. It comes with a USBC charger, and I like how you don't have to plug this one in on the bottom of the speaker. If you have other Ultimate Ears speakers you can pair them together to get a really cool effect. It was very easy to pair my phone to the speaker and I didn't have any issues playing my music or staying connected. This speaker worked perfectly. There are other very neat features on this version that I haven't even gone over like the Magic button, which lets you access other playlists. It is an awesome quality speaker and performs amazingly!

R3EZZ7KTPGO1V7,B0CVFM97GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Megaboom 4,bdDD,5.0,"I got the Black variant. This is a great-sounding Bluetooth portable speaker. It has a cylindrical form factor and is designed to stand vertically. It weighs a hair over 2 lbs but feels very portable. In addition to being rated IP67 waterproof, purportedly, it also floats for worry-free use near water.I see ‚Äúthunderous‚Äù used repeatedly on the product information page to describe the sound output but I think that creates unattainable expectations from a speaker this size. Nonetheless, the sound is big and --more evidently-- clear across the frequencies at all volume levels but tends to distort a little once you get close to 90% volume. EQ (5-band) can be customized via the UE Boom app, which is a great thing if you don't feel that any of the 5 presets from UE meet your needs. It doesn‚Äôt have a heavy bass thump (from its two passive radiators) but instead offers a more balanced and pleasant listening experience. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: there is bass for all the bass-heavy genres like hip-hop, EDM, but you won‚Äôt feel like you just left the club, and unlike many other speakers, that bass doesn‚Äôt come at the cost of mids and highs. Overall, it sounds more grown-up. I really like the 360-degree sound which UE claims is stereophonic, and I can only imagine how good sounding two of these would sound using the pairing feature.It charges via USB-C but the charging light is tucked down low and behind the flap that covers the charging port. It would have made more sense to place it up on top or where it would be easily viewable. On the upside, the battery life is purportedly 20 hrs. It has a tab (UE calls it a ‚Äúbungee‚Äù) near the top of the speaker that looks like it could hold a carabiner or strap but neither are included, only a charging cable. This projects a broader and clearer soundstage than my JBL Flip 6 and my Soundcore XMotion 300, but this sits in a higher price bracket. There is a ‚Äúmagic button‚Äù which is essentially a multipurpose single button to control pause/play, skip track, and purportedly can be used for one-touch control to access playlists from Spotify, AmazonMusic and Apple Music, according to one of the bullets on the product information page. When I tried to set this up on the UE Boom app, it only provided AmazonMusic and Apple Music as options (no Spotify!), with a note to check back later as they continue to add more music services.One neat but trivial feature via the UE Boom app is that you can talk into your phone and have it projected on the speaker, like a PA speaker. It also claims that it‚Äôs made with a minimum of 54% recycled plastic by weight.This is now my go-to Bluetooth speaker around the house.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AEA5LWYQIAMIJ25RVQBMCD6NQ2OQ,0,0,Color: Black,"July 28, 2024",2024-07-28,2024-07,Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 4 - Portable Waterproof 360deg Speaker
R3MFRLWN5UCX31,B0CVFM97GD,1.0 out of 5 stars Really overpriced for the sound you get.,J. Victor,1.0,"I had typed out a very long review and accidentally closed the window trying to change tabs. This is going to be shorter than that.I have the Wonderboom 4, Boom 4, Megaboom 4, and the Everboom. Out of all of them I think the smallest Wonderboom 4 sounds the best. They all get about the same loudness levels at max which is wild because they cost so much differently. The Megaboom 4 has the best sounding warmth, but it doesn't sound ""Good"". I have much cheaper speakers that sound better and get louder.I used a frequency generator to test the bass cutoff. Like the Everboom, it's 70hz. There is no sub bass response at all (under 60hz.) It sounds quite small despite it's price/size. It doesn't get very loud. It sounds muffled compared to other speakers, and has a hollow wooden character to vocals and guitars.I tested it against my two Earfun U Booms ($50 each) in TWS (True Wireless Stereo). Hands down night and day WAY better sound. Their bass response can reach down to 65hz. On paper that doesn't seem like much but it sure is noticeable. The U Booms at 50% volume were the same loudness as the Megaboom 4 at 75%. Volume is seriously lacking on the UE's (except the Wonderboom 4, it has good volume for it's price / size) The U Booms get MUCH louder than the Megaboom 4 at max.The Sony Ult1 is $130, it sounds far more natural with much deeper bass and more volume than the Megaboom4.The LFS Soundstorm is $130 with Boombox characteristics. With bass reaching down to 50hz, it sounds far bigger and get's super loud.The Mlove A200 is in the $95 price range, sounds much bigger and better. I could go on and on.I think you could buy a JBL Flip or Charge and it will also sound way better. I don't understand the UE fanboys. These speakers are a waste of money. (An argument can be made that the Wonderboom 4 is acceptable for it's price, but there are better sounding for the money like the Earfun U Boom)","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,0,0,Color: Black,"July 31, 2024",2024-07-31,2024-07,Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 4 - Portable Waterproof 360deg Speaker

R1JDJFQO569AU9,B0CVFM97GD,3.0 out of 5 stars Extremely overpriced speaker of just decent sound,bobwatts,3.0,"The media could not be loaded. I have always ascribed to the philosophy that if I‚Äôm going to listen to something, I require it to reproduce the One True Sound. In other words, as close to the original sound as possible. And I listen to music literally all day, sometimes all night also.Bluetooth speakers by definition are a compromise and will never be a substitute for a Real Sound System, but some manufacturers products perform a lot better than others. And it is an undeniable fact that Bluetooth and wireless speakers are getting far better.In the last four years alone, I have handled, listened to, tested and experienced hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and have written quite a few reviews. I bought a lot of them. Paid money. Some over $500.I don't claim ""audiophile"" status, but I am extremely discerning in my listening requirements.I will rarely mention competitors' products but might ""hint"" at something.I have been aware of Ultimate Ears products but have never purchased any, usually because I thought they were priced very high. Although they get good reviews (usually, certainly not always) I just didn't think that such a small speaker could deliver on the promise of ""Thundering Bass"". Well, they don't.I tried this speaker in every bass trap in my house that usually helps most speakers, and it did improve this speaker marginally. Using the speaker outside was pointless if volume and quality of sound is required.In the case of this speaker, it has 2"" drivers, one of each side of the cylindrical case. I am aware that this speaker has two passive radiators, and they are supposed to be ""softer"" than the Megaboom3 which ostensibly is supposed to improve bass response. I wouldn't expect much bass response from such small drivers, but the manufacturer clearly states ""Thundering Bass"" in the advertisement, and it is also on the box. (see picture).Not only have I heard smaller speakers with better bass, but I have heard and own many speakers costing far less than this one that outperforms this speaker by quite a large margin.I will say that for such a small speaker the bass response is remarkable, even good. But ""Thundering""?Ridiculous.And when cylindrical speakers claim to have ""360¬∞"" sound, this is usually a falsehood as well. You can definitely hear a difference when one of the two drivers is pointed at you. Assuming that you should keep the volume controls pointed at you means that the very directional high frequency sounds are going off to the sides, away from you. By simply turning the speaker 90¬∞ you will hear the difference.I was struck by the look and size of this speaker when I received it so much that I decided to get my 2015 9-year-old first generation Amazon Echo speaker out of storage and compare the units. (this turned out to be a one-hour debacle to get it going again, long story) The two speakers are almost the exact same size.The Megaboom4 definitely had more bass (not by much), but the Echo was a bit brighter and clearer in the sound delivery. (see video) I downloaded the Ultimate Ears ap immediately upon arrival of the speaker and ""tuned"" it to my liking (which is usually maximum treble and bass, drop the mids slightly for most speakers) so I gave it the best chance of sounding good/great. I also tried the ""signature"" settings.This speaker connects quickly and stays connected. Controls work well. Speaker has a very nice professional appearance, and the box protects it well during shipment. The box also has a high degree of professionalism in its appearance.I appreciate the lack of silly lights, and the connection ""sounds"" are not as obnoxious or silly as most speakers, but the turning off sound is very loud.Frankly I would have given this speaker four stars if the manufacturer had not claimed ""Thundering Bass"". That is an outrageously false claim. This speaker sounds very good for what it is, but for the price, I can buy many better speakers. I actually have.If I had purchased this speaker I would have returned it.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AHF7CXAQGU7WM5KXGQNMTYUOGWLQ,0,0,Color: Black,"July 31, 2024",2024-07-31,2024-07,Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 4 - Portable Waterproof 360deg Speaker

R3IPAK291EX7TC,B08NLCW9WY,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Loose audio jack. PartyBoost suffers from interference.,Tomas Ramirez Jr.,4.0,"Overall I like these speakers. They sound good. Plenty of volume and base. I like the strap and the hooks. Feels like good quality - mostly.This is my first time trying JBL speakers, and unfortunately, I ran into a bad batch of audio jacks. My first Extreme 3 was perfect; but I also got a Boombox 3 at the same time, and I the audio jack was too loose to hold. I exchanged the Boombox 3 for another, and it had the same issue. So I returned that, and got a second Extreme 3 - and unfortunately it also has a loose audio jack. However, the jack holds just well enough that I decided to keep it. For me, the audio jack is a critical feature.One of the main reasons I got this speaker was to see if PartyBoost would work as a whole-house audio system. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's extremely sensitive to interference. If you put the speakers in separate rooms, the sound like drops out and sounds staticy; and if you get too close to one of the speakers, it gets worse, and in some cases the sound completely stops. In fact, even in a single room, the speakers have to be pretty close without stuff or people passing in between.In fairness, I never read or heard that PartyBoost would work across rooms (and I figured it probably wouldn't); and I think all they say about it are meaningless things like ""amp up your party"" and ""take your party to the next level"". I suppose those are literally true in the sense that the volume increases. So, aside from the stereo feature, which I don't care about and didn't try, this is almost a useless feature.So, since it has two major features which I consider to be somewhat defective, I'm only giving it 4 stars, so that the reader is aware that something is probably not as expected with this speaker, as advertised.However, so far, other than the audio jack and PartyBoost, I am quite satisfied with this speaker.I haven't tried a ton of other BT speakers, but I have tried a couple of good ones, so I'll tell you how it compares.First, is my last speaker, which was the Soundcore Motion Boom. That speaker is basically like a direct competitor, and it sounds decent, but it does drop or flattens some of the sound detail. I think the Extreme 3 sounds better, but not so much better that it's obviously worth the increase in price. The Motion Boom is currently going for $85, and I think I paid like $120 when I got it, but the Xtreme 3 is currently going for $380. (Also just realized I been spelling it wrong this whole time.)But, the JBL has a few additional features. 1) Tweaters. 2) Audio Jack! 3) Anchor hooks. 4) Carrying strap. (And I guess technically PartyBoost.) But, the Xtreme 3 doesn't have a nice handle like the Motion Boom does; and I kind of think the round, rolly body of the JBL is kind of a bad thing; whereas the Motion Boom has a rectangular body that won't roll away so easily. I kind of wish they both had a handle and carrying strap, so its kind of a trade-off; but I do think the anchor points on the Xtreme 3 are a little more flexible. I can just attach a handle, if I can find/fashion one. I could also do that with the Motion Boom (and I did), but it's more awkward, since the handle is basically a wide tube.The other speaker I can kind-of compare it to is the Sony SRSX5, which is a much older speaker; and it's been a couple of years since I had it; but I remember it sounding very nice. Well, I think the Xtreme 3 is probably just as nice, except a couple of small differences. I think the Xtreme 3 is probably a little more punchy (as the Motion Boom is) and I suspect that's because of their outdoorsy, waterproofy design. Also, the SRSX5 is kind of bass heavy, and has a more mellow sound, which I kind of didn't like about it. But either way, I think some people might prefer either sound over the other; so they're about the same in my opinion.Other than that, the SRSX5 and Xtreme 3 are not really comparable, because they're different sizes, and the SRSX5 is not designed to be an outdoors speaker. They're designed for different environments. But I think the sound comparison is still relevant and valuable. In many settings, I think they'll have similar sound abilities. I would think the Xtreme 3 could get louder than the SRSX5, since it is bigger; but honestly, I don't know.I guess another thing I can compare on these 3 speakers is quality and durability; and overall they all seem like good quality, durable devices; with the exception of that one Xtreme 3 with the loose audio jack; and unfortunately, since I found 3 JBL 3-series speakers with such loose audio jacks, that casts some doubt about the quality of the JBL brand; especially in $300-$500 speakers.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2023",AELEPQAY45NIRTP5JEVZBZKN7HOQ,1,57,Color: Black,"January 21, 2023",2023-01-21,2023-01,JBL,JBL Xtreme 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

No comparison and sent the pulse 4 back. This extreme is perfect for gatherings and solid built. I‚Äôm sure with the extreme 4 coming out this will drop in price even more but around $170 is a steal and the sound towers over the pulse 4. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs better but aesthetics / looks / size / clarity & at the 52%price discount this is a home run for me. It also has a JBL EQ app & Amazon gave me 90 days of free Amazon Music.

R15BK4GG9J1CB,B08NLCW9WY,3.0 out of 5 stars Sound isn't as it is hyped to be.,JB,3.0,"This is my opinion about this speaker and there is no right or wrong but hopefully information that helps other people figure out if they are wiling to pay the price for what they will get (I think it is pricy three-fifty at the time of this review). Either this speaker is over-hyped or there was something wrong with mine. It had a good amount of bass (not low, but mid bass) and very poor mids. The highs were somewhat tinny sounding and a little hissy at much over 50 percent volume. Most vocals sounded like the singer was singing into a cup or soup can and there were many mid range sounds (keyboard, guitar, etc.) that you could barely hear ...they were very muffled. It sounded meh at best with club music, but rock, country, acoustic or any other music with emphasis on vocals, strings and keybaord instruments wasn't great. Ever listen to Van Halen and barely hear Eddie's guitar? How about Kenny Chesney sounding like he has a coffee cup in front of his mouth? Or, what about a very dull sounding ukulele with Iz singing Beautiful World? That isn't good my ears. I will admit that I am into sound and have had quality equipment (I played nice electric guitars through Marshall half stacks with tube heads and a lot of effects like Rockman-Scholz, Alesis, and listening to music with B&O H9i headphones, Focals in my HD, etc). That isn't meant to act like I'm better or have better audio abilities than anyone but is meant to give examples of fairly good quality audio products that I've used and like (yet no where near top of the line obviously). I prefer a warmer or richer sound and that's just what I like. It doesn't mean I'm right if it isn't what you like and prefer so my point is that it is fairly subjective. I like deep clean bass, warm vocals and clean realistic highs that aren't tinny or hissy sounding. The sound that I heard from the Xtreme 3 was a decent mid level bass punch for a portable speaker, but not low bass (as the specs say so it is to be expected), a very dull or muffled mid range and then a tinny sounding high with piercing and hissy extreme highs (at higher volume levels). Because of that, I couldn't recommend this speaker for many types of music. Maybe some club songs would be ok. I believe youtubers can easily mislead (or lie) even if they don't mean to. I watched many reviews and speaker comparisons but the problem with doing that is that it isn't known how the speakers were recorded and how the sound was processed for the video. I never saw the microphones used and they aren't in the videos when the speaker comparisons were played so where were they placed in relationship to the speaker(s) to record the sound ...what distance, what angle to the speakers, etc. After recording the sound, how much was the recorded sound processed (like people using photoshop and lightroom to process photos and make a photo look nothing like the real life view did). I'm not saying they did, but I could take a set of 5 thousand dollar speakers and a single portable speaker (like the Xtreme) and record both, use Audacity to modify the sounds recorded from each and make a video claiming that the Xtreme sounds better by using the modified sounds to 'prove' it. To add to that, what speakers are being used to listen to the comparisons (I used both my Bang & Olufsen H9i headphones and my computer's Logitech Z623 (nice affordable 2.1 computer speakers)? They'd have to be better audio quality than the speakers being tested in order to be able to reproduce the sound (example: you can't listen to a 35Hz sound that a video is making if your speaker can't go below 60Hz). How would you know that the speaker sounds warm if your speaker playing the video isn't capable of reproducing that warm sound? If you are looking for a speaker that is fairly portable this may serve you fine and you may love this speaker but honestly, I'd take my cheap little Bose Mini II SoundLink (4 years old) out to the pool before carrying this one since I don't need it too loud and the overall sound quality is richer sounding (less bass but better mids for general music) ...but if you were wanting loud, the Xtreme 3 blows it out of the water (no waterproof pun intended). It really comes down to your expectations and what you are willing to pay. If I had a max of three fifty to spend and wanted something this size or smaller I would probably get the first or second gen instead ..put the saved money towards more music or whatever (or a second speaker to pair together). I think that if the sound produced by either of those is great to you then it probably isn't enough better sound quality to justify getting the Xtreme 3 for the price difference. Without playing them side to side (like may videos), you probably wouldn't hear enough difference to justify the cost. Maybe there was an issue with the Xtreme 3 I received so take this all as my opinion and possibly a defective product (all manufacturers have occasional bad ones). If you already have an Xtreme 3 and love it, that's great and all that really matters. But for people trying to figure out which Xtreme generation to spend their hard earned money on, I would get one (or a pair) of the older ones over this 3rd gen. I will return this and try the Aiwa Exos-9 which is bigger but less money (of course, it sounds a lot better in youtube video comparisons, but I only take that for what it's worth ..wink, wink).","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2021",AE5YWERPDNA7INEP4QNVID7AR6OA,1,309,Color: Black,"January 7, 2021",2021-01-07,2021-01,JBL,JBL Xtreme 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

It is definitely better in every way over the charge 5 other than being larger and heavier. It's louder and the battery lasts considerably longer than the charge 5. The party boost is good and nice to have but often there seems to be glitches in the receiving speakers, sometimes cutting out and all, could be better but it's nice to use. I also have the Boombox 3, which in my opinion is far superior to any of the other wireless speakers JBL offers but it is much larger and heavier. That being said, while I like the smaller charge 5 at times for grab and go portability, the xtreme 3 has better sound and a better battery for the job, but I would recommend getting it on sale as it is not worth $300 I paid at the time. I picked up my boombox 3 for $350 on sale and it's a far far better speaker, prob would not have even bought this one had the boombox been out then.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AFEWXJIY664PDNRQOE7NFNRS3DGQ,1,4,Color: Black,"November 17, 2023",2023-11-17,2023-11,JBL,JBL Xtreme 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

It sounds great , punchy and crisp at %20 - %60 volume but starts to distort and or clip at the higher end which is kindof where I was expecting it to cut thru. (I might be spoiled by my boombox but the boombox is huge to lug around to work and other places where you don't need to put on a concert, that's where the X3 will shine I believe). I got his one on a %26 off sale and it was still 300 after taxes, I know it's relatively new so the price is still pretty high but I have a feeling I'll grow to justify it over the coming days.I didn't have any connection issues like others described , I have the JBL app and it paired seamlessly. I'm not a huge fan of their ""EQ"" as it only has 3 points of adjustment so I've turned it off and use my own on my S23u called poweramp in combination with ATMOS and it does well, just again the sound output starts to deteriorate at the higher end.I really like the Blue grill , and the red outline of the letters , it's much nicer looking in person than the advertisement photos so if that's your jam I suggest it.Will update about 1 week from now , especially with the battery life claim...

R2B0RIAONXX9WN,B08NLCW9WY,3.0 out of 5 stars Good overall but not what I expected :/,Ariel,3.0,"Thinking this would be a huge upgrade from the jbl charge 5, I was really looking forward to this xtreme 3! It was also a birthday gift for a bass loving enthusiast. This one pretty much as the same bass quality as a older model jbl speaker we have. It's the jbl 4 think. It's Lacking that deep bass you love that shakes the floor. It's a massive portable speaker but not the size of the boombox. It's heavy and has very good vocals, acoustic sounds and great overall basic sound. But the bass is just plain sad. I get that if you take this thing to the beach or wherever you're going it'll be loud enough to entertain the area you're in. It's a good portable speaker but not for almost 400$!! If I needed a portable speaker I'd probably just get the normal sized one and call it a day. It does feel like a waste of money for it's size and good reviews. We tested it against a really old speaker that we have, a tower, and it just lacks that deep deep bass that gets you excited to listen to songs with bass. We tested the hills by the weekend, sosa(remix rl grime) by chief keef and all gold everything(remix) by trinidad james. When I gave the present to my girlfriend she was also bummed at the sound of the bass. Jbl is known for their quality of speakers and this was disappointing. There is a very sad app you can also download for the speaker that let's you adjust treble, bass and mid but it really didn't make any difference. If you're a bass lover looking for something to blow you away this isn't it at all. Everytime the bass would drop it left us empty inside. If you're not into deep bottom bass then this would be a good cruise speaker to have since it is portable, Bluetooth and so easy to use. It's even got the party share on it so you can connect multiple speakers to play together! It's really cool actually but no good for any kind of bass.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AFU4TAEHVBIYLZ4E2WUE5VN2SPBA,1,2,Color: Camo,"December 4, 2023",2023-12-04,2023-12,JBL,JBL Xtreme 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I like my music clear but also punchy and I was able to get a clear sound while also boosting the low end to get a nice punchy sound. I haven't had the opportunity to crank the volume to the max setting simply because it's loud enough at about the 70% range for me. The battery did great, I charged it overnight and took it on a weekend trip and played music almost all day and even got to charge some of our phones without ever charging the speaker again. It also rained on my trip and the water didn't seem to damage the speaker which was also something I was looking for as I will be taking my speaker to the pool often.

Only problem is it's not as loud using aux (I tried a few differnt input devices to test this) I ended up buying a ""hifi"" headphone amp that works pretty good at increasing the overall volume . Even on bluetooth this speaker isn't as loud as I origionally hoped. I was a little disappointed but your opinion may differ depending on personal preference. I like LOUD and my hearing is probabaly damaged. The bass is pretty good on max volume and doesn't distort.I haven't been able to connect to it with the JBL android app via bluetooth (music streaming works fine). I've tried 5 different phones and all sorts of troubleshooting methods. It just refuses to connect and I gave up on it.The shape and overall design of this thing is goofy to say the least. It looks like some kind of...bean? Put in on a bed, uneven surface or a slight incline, and its gonna roll right over and maybe even roll away. And btw I dont know whose idea it was to match bright orange with camo...but hey...thats just me. The good side though is that it's very portable and seems to be a fairly durable design.The battery life is really good and you can charge other usb devices off of it, a pretty cool feature. Unfortunately someday that battery is gonna wear out and die..and I'm betting its not easy to replace.. but I havent looked into it yet. It's certainly not designed to be easily user replaceable and may compromise the waterproof-ability if you try to. I haven't had it in the rain or the shower so I cant speak to the waterproof claim, but the rubber gasket around the aux&usb ports seems legit.Don't mind me, I forget sometimes we're in the 21st century and everything is planned obsolescence, meant to be thrown away after a few years so you go and buy a new one.At first I had buyers remorse, pretty bad. Now much less. Especially because the hefty price tag at the time. BUT this device started to grow on me more and more over time. If it lasts a while, I may up it to 4 stars.I really should have bought a deemer box (or whatever they're called, my friend has one) or built my own with a bluetooth amp, speakers, LFP battery pack inside of a pelican box.. But I wanted something now and impulse bought this. If you're a tech/DIYer I would recommend you consider other options. But this speaker is decent and I havent had many other devices for comparison. For most folk's I'd say this speaker is not a bad option, that is if the price is right.","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2023",AHCGS2TTTTX74TE2PHPUECPLGZRA,1,5,Color: Camo,"May 21, 2023",2023-05-21,2023-05,JBL,JBL Xtreme 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

The extreme three can be played louder, and it‚Äôs waterproof, so if you want to use it outdoors or in a very large room, it might be the better choice. but indoors, in an average size room, a pair of flip 6‚Äôs in stereo mode produces a sound quality that is truly fantastic. You can place each small flip 6 speaker exactly where you want it to get the best stereo sound, and the quality of the sound is better than that of the Extreme 3. For either the 3 or the 6‚Äôs, the JBL speaker app gives you a great sound equalizer control to manage trouble, base, and mid range, as well as volume, and with the push of a button, you can switch The right left position of the stereo output. Alternatively, you can use a single speaker without using the app. just turn on your cell phone or computer‚Äôs Bluetooth, push the Bluetooth button on the top of the speaker, and you‚Äôre all set.

This player is beautiful to look at; listen to and will impress everyone...the bass is perfect, thumping, and poignant and for the type of music that I listen to, that trance dance stuff this is the right player...I will say it's too beautiful to have leave the house, This is a tight player that I think for my uses, deck listening on the weekends this will last many weekends...I have about 5 - 6 of these types of players and they all serve a different purpose. Life is too short not to have one of these...So I would say do it it's worth the money. I bought this to replace the one that mysteriously got broken from the bathroom and now I feel that this is too nice to keep in the bathroom, so I'll probably use one of the other players I have in there. You'll love this player. I gave the portability of this player 3 stars because it is thick to pick up without the straps.

Why would they do this? The base is hyped to try to impress and needs to be dialed back for clarity. And the EQ that it does have on the mobile app is only 3 bands with 5 positions each! Why?? And if you connect it to something else, you lose the EQ settings, even when you connect back to the mobile app. IMO there should be at least a 5-band graphic EQ built into the back, or it should let you save settings to the speaker itself, and since it's digital it should give you 12-bands with continuous faders.

In the end I decided that the Extreme 3 was worth the extra money. I returned all but the Extreme 3. The JBL Boombox is far better than all of the above, but it‚Äôs also nearly twice the price. The Extreme 3 definitely sounds better than linking two Flip 4s. The sound is especially good if you are indoors and you place it on a 45deg angle in the corner. I worked outside all day and it sounded great as well. My only real complaint is that you cannot link JBL Party Boost with JBL Connect +. Overall, it‚Äôs a very impressive speaker.

RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6S748H,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4.0,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you‚Äôve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it‚Äôs okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don‚Äôt try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you‚Äôre pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I‚Äôm missing the mark on its intended use, but I don‚Äôt think so. For small sound and high portability, it‚Äôs okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I‚Äôll have to sample it for a while and along others. I‚Äôm on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I‚Äôll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it‚Äôs pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it‚Äôs been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it‚Äôs worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,1,8,Color: White,"July 8, 2024",2024-07-08,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

It has great tonality and an expansive sound stage, one which is tailored to your listening area. I have tried a lot of mobile blue tooth speakers, and this is one of the best in terms of audio quality, which is, absolutely, one of the most impot5rant factors, really the most important. I would compare it only to the Klipsch, B & O, Devialet.So why did I rate it 4 stars?1. I find it insulting or worse when a piece of equipment in this price range is so intrusive, puts so much effort into violating your privacy. Install the app and you will have none. I fully intend to uninstall rhe app. I may even do a full reset on my phone, but having installed it and created an accoujnt I asm already on a list they wil undoubtedly be selling.You can set up blue tooth without the app, but not wifi. Having connected to blue tooth I had to reset the speaker to install the app. It took me hou4rs, much like the B & O, which I was unhappy with for exactly the same reasons.*IF* you use th3 app you can not use a music player. I personally hate listening to music on my phone. In fact, I needed to make a call but couldn't because I was using the speaker, and it completely drained the battery on my phone. (Wifi and blue tooth will do that) make a call and could not because I was using the speaker. It also completely drained my phone's battery.2. Using a player would not have given me the benefits I get on many other blue tooth speakers because the Roam does not process lossless blue tooth codecs. You lose detail in transmission. Not everyone cares about this but most audiophile listeners do, so for a company of this quality, producing equipment in this price range, it is surprising and disappointing.No aptx, aptx hd or ldac.It does do some tricks if you have other Sonos speakers, like casting to the speaker in the next room.3. IPX rating questionable. The port is open, uncovered. I would not take this speaker to the beach, or even out ion the rain.With or without the app? The app does get you spatial tuning, BUT, besides issues already mentioned I lost the DAC on my FIIO, in addition to lossless blue tooth.In sum, the sound is very good but I feel that you pay a high price for it in terms of intrusiveness.I do not feel as though I would be sacrificing a great deal if I listened to my Klipsch instead, on my FIIO, weith location... turned off on my phone. We all have our priorities. Mine is most definitely sound quality, and this speaker do3es sound very good but I hzavwe to question some of their choices, to include not using lossless blue tooth codecs.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,0,1,Color: White,"June 18, 2024",2024-06-18,2024-06,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

The size is easy to carry around, and it has really good sound for such a small form factor. The Alexa integration is also very good - you can power up the speaker and ask Alexa to play anything through connected services like Spotify or other music libraries and it does what you expect it to do - play music! The real let down is in in the recent overhaul of the Sonos app. Unfortunately, Sonos took a very good functioning S2 app and ruined it when they relaunched the app to handle the new Sonos Ace headphones. They've been working on re-adding features for the last two months and it's starting to improve, but very slowly. So buyer beware - you may want to wait until they get the app back to a more solid state before you jump into a Roam. However, the Roam does work well with Bluetooth and Airplay, so for now that's a great way to still play music.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AH2NLQV3HKYPSPZJAU2FGCUV37GA,0,0,Color: Black,"July 30, 2024",2024-07-30,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

This is easy competition for Beats pill or the Bose versions in this size group and better in many ways. One of the ways is the tech. Also known as the bad reviews, at least for now. They need to update some areas with the software and the app. This needs to work perfect for what it cost (I hope you hear me Sonos!). If they fix the connectivity and wifi issues this is a winner. If you want a great piece of hardware with stand alone function it's a winner. For owners of other Sonos products having issues, they owe you an apology and a quick solution.

I've used Sonos speakers in the past and was pretty impressed with those. This speaker in particular though, I have to honestly say is not quite as good as some other Sonos I have used in the past. Pairing over Bluetooth is simple, as with like any other Bluetooth speaker or other device. Pairing is the same. But like the other Sonos speakers this is also made specifically to work with the Sonos App in which you can connect multiple speakers throughout a home. That works well but I struggle to see why that'd be important on a portable speaker. I suppose it is nice to have the option. The sound is very good. It can get loud enough for a whole room. The trembles and mids are nice and clear. The bass is loud too (but I did notice some mudding at higher volume which is honestly to be expected with a portable speaker like this.) I took off the one star for this.Overall I think this is a very good speaker and people who want the Sonos app connectivity will love this. But I took off the one star because the sound is about the same as some other premium Bluetooth speakers that cost significantly less.

Setup was pretty straightforward, but I did need to reboot it a couple times to get it to properly play in sync with the other speakers. I think that may have just been a one-time thing, since it's worked perfectly every other time I've sent music to it.In terms of sound, it's pretty good. It doesn't have a super rich bass, compared to my other Sonos speakers, but it's still decent. I use the overture from Tron: Legacy as a test track, so I have a reference I can compare on each speaker I listen on, and it does miss some of the really rich deep notes when the music swells at around 1:35.All that said, this isn't a one-speaker-replacement for an amazing sound system. It's a portable speaker that sounds pretty great, which is suitable for taking outdoors and can sync with your existing Sonos system, and it excels at that.

I ordered the white version since all our others are white, and I think it looks great. That said,black might be the better choice is you plan to take it to the beach, etc.Overall, delighted with the performance and am happy to have this addition to our home audio network.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AFKLQ3HGT34CX66IWOTPAA3POHQQ,0,0,Color: White,"June 15, 2024",2024-06-15,2024-06,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker
RJFBNJKX05C8K,B0CY6S748H,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic!,MKR,5.0,"I am usually drawn to Bose products. I have also used the JBL charge speakers. I took a flyer on this one, and I am glad I did. The sound is very, very good. For jazz, it is refined, revealing the highs of a tinkling cymbal to steady bass lines; the sound is well-articulated. For something like Beyonce's Cowboy Carter, it revealed the lower nuances in her voice and a pleasantly booming bass. Overall, I found that the sound was fuller and richer at higher volumes, something I did not expect. It is absolutely stunning in a large room out by the pool. At lower volumes in my office, it feels slightly underpowered. At high volumes in my office...well, I don't get much done. I love this little thing! I had no trouble connecting to Bluetooth, either, and battery life is crazy. I used it from 10 am to 4 pm yesterday without any problems and it's still going today.

The setup process took a good 30 minutes. The app is terrible, you are forced to create a Sonos account just to use a bluetooth speaker. There's no way to set it up without making an account and agreeing to their terms and marketing emails, so red flag there.

There isn‚Äôt an employee at Sonos who isn‚Äôt pained by having let you down, and I assure you that fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be our number one priority.We developed the new app to create a better experience, with the ability to drive more innovation in the future, and with the knowledge that it would get better over time. However, since launch we have found a number of issues. Fixing these issues has delayed our prior plan to quickly incorporate missing features and functionality.Since May 7, we have released new software updates approximately every two weeks, each making significant and meaningful improvements, adding features and fixing bugs. Please see the release notes for Sonos software updates for detailed information on what has been released to date.While these software updates have enabled the majority of our customers to have a robust experience using the Sonos app, there is more work to be done. We have prioritized the following improvements in our next phase of software updates:July and August:- Improving the stability when adding new products- Implementing Music Library configuration, browse, search, and playAugust and September:- Improving Volume responsiveness- User interface improvements based on customer feedback- Improving overall system stability and error handlingSeptember:- Improving Alarm consistency and reliabilitySeptember and October:- Restoring edit mode for Playlists and the Queue- Improving functionality in settings- We plan to continue releasing new software updates on a bi-weekly cadence. With each release, we will share detailed notes on what we‚Äôve addressed and what we‚Äôre working on next in our Community.We deeply appreciate your patience as we address these issues.

You can tailor your sound using the Sonos App. I had a little trouble syncing my speaker to the app because you need to make sure the speaker is in set up mode (meaning the green light needs to be lit). My speaker came in pairing mode so I was confused when I couldn't sync to the app. I had to factory reset the speaker to get the app to recognize the speaker. After that I was up and running.

To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

R2N9LGOT33J14T,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars A Posh Music speaker!,RT - Gadget Guy,4.0,"B&O makes posh high end audio gear‚Ä¶.gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard ‚ÄúType II anodization‚Äù on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it‚Äôs hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it‚Äôs water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don‚Äôt expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there‚Äôs just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn‚Äôt reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn‚Äôt reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it‚Äôs a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn‚Äôt necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don‚Äôt want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it‚Äôs still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don‚Äôt mind paying more for something that feels like it‚Äôs going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional).

I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I‚Äôm camping. It‚Äôs a small space so I don‚Äôt need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I‚Äôm thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it‚Äôs just a wireless speaker. It‚Äôs not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it‚Äôs a good value. I guess I‚Äôm comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. ü§© I can crank it to infinity and it‚Äôs crystal clear.

Also bass can be increased in the app and it doesn‚Äôt drown out the vocals like most equalizers do.

RDUDX86L13ELO,B08YRT9T38,5.0 out of 5 stars I really like it!,Rod,5.0,"I‚Äôve seen too many bad reviews on this one so I wanted to give my opinion. First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn‚Äôt really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA,1,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker,"October 13, 2023",2023-10-13,2023-10,JBL,JBL Flip 5 - Portable Waterproof Speaker
R2OOWD9I530XTQ,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars Absolute gem.......but a disappointing low amount of bass,Tim,4.0,"Let me start off by saying I did a LOT for research on smaller Bluetooth speakers before making a purchase ‚Äì which includes reading review/articles and listening to YouTube reviews. I currently have a 3rd generation Oontz Angle 3 Ultra that‚Äôs I‚Äôve had for 6 years and was in need of replacing ‚Äì not because it was worn out, but I just wanted something newer and nicer but generally the same size with more power/more clarity. The B&O explore caught my attention right away due to the design and name. The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsmart speak‚Äô. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me‚Ä¶..except for the bass. There just isn‚Äôt any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just can‚Äôt deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesn‚Äôt justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect ‚Äì if expensive ‚Äì speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100 ‚Äì so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ,1,19,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker,"June 5, 2023",2023-06-05,2023-06,JBL,JBL Flip 5 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It‚Äôs a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn‚Äôt change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because it‚Äôs metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I haven‚Äôt been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because it‚Äôs well made as well.

R16YFTNSO98JTM,B08YRT9T38,2.0 out of 5 stars Awesome! (‚Ä¶for a year‚Ä¶),alrightalrightalright,2.0,"I‚Äôm super picky about my Bluetooth speakers. I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I‚Äôm so glad I gave this a shot. It‚Äôs perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it‚Äôs coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it‚Äôs super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I‚Äôm not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it‚Äôs not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little ‚Äútinny‚Äù once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you‚Äôll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play.

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose‚Äôs sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos‚Äô Roam is a close runner-up, but it‚Äôs sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

R2N9GZ6YLXIHZ6,B08YRT9T38,1.0 out of 5 stars Don‚Äôt waste money in B&O crappy products,DMONVE,1.0,"I recently purchased a Bang & Olufsen speaker, attracted by its sleek design and premium external materials. Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ,1,12,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker,"October 25, 2023",2023-10-25,2023-10,JBL,JBL Flip 5 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

Aluminum outer-body and a textured rubber top and bottom surface give this speaker a very high quality feel, BUT when it comes to sound quality (or lack thereof), it's just not good. It sounds like a speaker I'd get at a Dollar General or through some sketchy eBay listing. Even with the B&O app and after fine tuning, the sound is consistently crunchy and subtly muffled. The treble is in no way smooth or clear and the bass is almost inaudible (even with the B&O app tuned for the most bass possible).The songs I used to test this speaker's high and low ranges were:- Nonstop: Drake- Tip Toes: half alive- Natural: The Driver Era- bad guy: Billie Eilish- Correct: MNEK- Old Town Road: Lil Nas X (feat.

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5.0,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,1,155,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"October 1, 2022",2022-10-01,2022-10,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R2X7MVZ50QBR2H,B08VL5S148,"5.0 out of 5 stars As someone who had the first version since 2017, this is a noticeable improvement",Phoenix Lain,5.0,"TLDR: Great sound quality, great portability and size, and holds a good charge (5-6 hours at 50% - 70% volume.) The charging cradle is a must own if you buy this. It‚Äôs durable and holds up well, but it can dent and ding with relative ease; but it doesn‚Äôt effect the sound quality. I got more than 5+ years out of my first one, and it still works. The Bose app is great and easy to link multiple devices. Where this speaker absolutely shines is in Party Mode/Stereo Mode. It actually gives my Bose Smart Soundbar 900 a run (Only possible with two of these revolve+ in Stereo Mode; however, you can link any other Bose Soundlink speakers to it as well.) Silver hides dirt better than the black, but the black handle hides dirt better than the silver handle. The black also hides dents and dings a little better. One downside is the charging cradle only comes in black. If you can wait patiently, and would like to save some money; you can find this around $100 off retail during black Friday sales, Amazon Day sales, and during random flash sales.The first one I owned was a Silver Soundlink Revolve+ that I used daily, for roughly 5 years. Then after getting a PC, and finding out my monitor didn‚Äôt have speakers, I decided I wanted one more to connect with my PC (since I was always moving my silver series 1 back and forth.)But after seeing how effortlessly it connects to bluetooth, and being able to tell a difference in the quality of sound (from heavy everyday use for 5+ years) I felt like it would bother me. Before I hadn‚Äôt noticed it, but after comparing them directly, and using party mode/stereo mode (linking them ) I could tell my silver OG soundlink revolve+ was just a touch not as clear. If both were new, I‚Äôm pretty sure the only difference between the two would be the ease of bluetooth connection on the series 2 (this one.) The battery is pretty much about the same in my experience, but honestly I leave it on the cradle 95% of the time. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say the Series 2 might be slightly better overall, but I‚Äôm inclined to think it has more with the software than a battery upgrade.However, it‚Äôs nice to grab and walk through the house from chore to chore while listening to an audiobook, podcast, or other media content. As far as portable speakers go, I think this is right in the pocket. It‚Äôs compact enough that it‚Äôs easily packed in a backpack, or drawstring bag; but it‚Äôs also loud enough that it‚Äôs worth carrying with you. Honestly, some smaller lower quality speakers just aren‚Äôt really worth the trouble. For example, my first Jambox, or my first JBL portable speaker. Those were both pretty mid to be honest, neither lasted more than 1.5 years.The sound quality is supurb, and has a nice overall balance between the high‚Äôs and bass. It‚Äôs very clear, even when it‚Äôs loud. My only recommendation would be to buy the charging cradle as it makes everything so much easier. I do feel like for the price it should include the charging cradle, but whatever.Ultimately, I was happy enough with the series 1 Soundlink Revolve+ that I decided to add another one. Then after hearing the sound degradation after 5 years, I decided to buy another. Honestly, without comparing them side by side, you‚Äôd never notice. But unfortunately I did, and then it always bothered me. I decided to retire my OG Silver Soundlink Revolve+ and gave it to a friend. He couldn‚Äôt believe I would give it away like that, but I assured him that I got every penny out of those 5+ years. He‚Äôs been using the OG revolve+ for more than a year now. And I‚Äôve been using my two Series 2 revolve+ for more than a year as well. Both have held up great even with daily use. For reference, I usually listen at around 50% - 70% volume. Where this speaker really shines is in Party Mode/Stereo Mode with two of these Revolve + speakers. It honestly gives my Bose Smart Soundbar a good and close run. It‚Äôs a pretty pricy investment, but it can be easier to justify knowing you‚Äôll easily get 5+ years out of it. Just don‚Äôt have it turned up to 100 all the time for hours at a time, and it should last you a very long time.PS: In all honesty, I think the Silver hides dirty and grime better than the black does. It sounds like the opposite would be true, but the black show‚Äôs every spec of dust, and finger prints standout a lot more. The only downside was the charging cradle only comes in black. The only benefit to the black color in my experience is that the black handle does hide dirt better. So it‚Äôs kind of a trade off. I got the black speakers this time around just as a refresher, I kinda wanted it to feel new and unfamiliar. In all honesty, after spending a year with the black, I‚Äôd say personally I prefer the silver. But the black does match the cradle, and it the handle hides dirt a little better. The black also hides dents and dings a little better too, but not by much. After 5+ years with OG revolve+ it had a number of smaller dents from being knocked around, thrown, falling off the table/desk, etc.. it‚Äôs made well, and you no doubt get what you pay for.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023",AHJFDIUB6JRTAIMCQ3K3VNMWF6SA,1,68,Color: Black,"September 18, 2023",2023-09-18,2023-09,JBL,JBL Flip 4 - Portable Waterproof Speaker
RP9RA3M8VT6JQ,B08VL5S148,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing speaker, but why no USBC?!?!?",Jeremy,5.0,"I treated myself to the Bose SoundLink speaker, and am glad I chose this over some other less expensive options. I am genuinely blown away by its exceptional performance and versatility.THE GOOD- Build: From the moment I unboxed the Bose SoundLink, I was immediately impressed by its sleek and modern design. Its compact form factor makes it incredibly portable, and the build quality is outstanding. The soft-touch materials and sturdy construction exude a sense of durability that assures me it's built to last.- Sound: The real magic, however, lies in its audio performance. The SoundLink delivers a rich, immersive sound that's hard to believe could come from a speaker of this size. The bass response is surprisingly punchy, mids are clear and vibrant, and the highs are crisp without being harsh. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, streaming podcasts, or watching movies, the sound quality is consistently phenomenal.- Connectivity: One feature that sets the SoundLink apart from the competition is its impressive Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing my devices is a breeze, and the connection remains stable even when I'm in another room. The wireless range is quite impressive, allowing me to move freely without worrying about losing the connection.- Battery: Another standout feature is the battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to recharge, making it a reliable companion for extended listening sessions or outdoor adventures. The convenience of having a portable speaker with such a long-lasting battery is a game-changer.THE MEDIOCRE- Charging cable: Not a huge deal, but not having a USBC on a premium product purchased in 2023 is a miss. The micro USB has worked well over the past 6 months, but I still would much prefer the new standard USBC cable and can't fathom why it wasn't included in this version of the speaker.- Voice: For a premium speaker in 2023, I also thoguht the voice would be improved and sound more natural. Every time I turn this on, it automatically connects to my phone and says, ""Connected to ..."". The voice it uses to say this seems like it is from 2011 when Siri was introduced. It's by no means a deal breaker, but my expectation was higher at this pricepoint.What truly sets the Bose SoundLink apart, though, is its remarkable portability. I've taken it on hikes, to the beach, and even used it at picnics, and it has never disappointed. The built-in handle is a thoughtful addition, making it easy to carry, and its water-resistant design offers peace of mind during unexpected rain showers.In summary, the Bose SoundLink is a powerhouse of a portable speaker, offering impressive sound quality, ease of use, and incredible portability. It has quickly become an essential part of my daily life, ensuring that I never compromise on audio quality, no matter where I go. If you're looking for a portable speaker that delivers outstanding performance, look no further. The Bose SoundLink is a true gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a premium audio experience on the go.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2023",AHCOIYZTARA6FT4VPO2FFR2OBMQA,1,56,Color: Black,"October 11, 2023",2023-10-11,2023-10,JBL,JBL Flip 4 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

R1RFJO1FULF3WU,B08VL5S148,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, not great",Christopher Hansen,3.0,"Update after a month of useI like this unit more than I did initially.While it‚Äôs not as powerful as some of its competitors, it does shine in several categories.This unit really excels in smaller spaces. It really does well when it‚Äôs placed in a corner. It‚Äôs 360 degree sound profile uses the walls to bounce and project sound, using the corner walls as a pseudo speaker cabinet. Sound is much richer used this way.Portability is also a key ingredient. Size and form factor plat a big part. The ‚Äòkiller feature‚Äô is the handle. I know that sounds dumb, but it is really, really useful.The lithium ion battery is also a monster. Took this to the beach, boating and back to a bbq, and only used 25% of the battery life after a full day of activity.The Bose Connect app is what everyone else should aspire to. No gimmicky features. Start it up, connect to your paired device and then stream whatever audio you want from any app.The unit supports multiple people connecting to it simultaneously via Bose Connect so no more ‚Äòwait while I un-pair‚Äô so a friend can play the next song.I‚Äôve also found this is a great audio pairing option for laptop and desktop audio. Much better sound quality than stock speakers, wireless Bluetooth freedom. Our old 27‚Äô‚Äô iMac is in the guest bedroom and we paired this to create a simple audio video system that works quite well for when guests visit.I also use the device occasionally when we golf.When I tested it out at the beach, sound quality was average to good and loudness was enough that we found ourselves constantly turning it down so as to not offend people nearby.Previous review points (below) still apply. Probably would boost it a star if it were cheaper. $300+tax is a big bite for a device of this size. I will keep the unit. I did decide to keep the unit, but mostly just because I can afford to do so.Purchased this unit based upon a ton of positive reviews. Bose clearly took a page out of the Apple design playbook. Very well designed. The handle is a simple, yet awesome feature. The unit is a lot smaller than the pictures depicts.Top quality packaging, and simple setup make using this a breeze. Requires the Bose Connect app from the App Store. The device is primarily intended to be paired to a mobile device or tablet. Skip the Bose opt in (as if we need yet another account and more emails, kthx)Here‚Äôs the rub:While this is an interesting Bluetooth device, it‚Äôs a VERY expensive device. By comparison I paid about $50 more for a HEOS 5 that blows this out of the water in terms of sound quality. While the HEOS isn‚Äôt portable, the bar is pretty high.Overall sound quality is ok, not amazing. Lots of mid range and treble. Bass is present but it‚Äôs not very pronounced. ‚ÄòAcceptable‚Äô but not great.Overall volume output is good, but it‚Äôs not sensational. You‚Äôre not going to throw any keggers or raves. I suspect a small to medium sized group of people wouldn‚Äôt enjoy this very much if they were super talkative of having a lot of fun. I think for lounging on the deck it would be fine. I question whether this unit would be very good for outdoor use. It just doesn‚Äôt have the oomf power to produce enough volume, and I suspect sound quality would be a lot less also.It‚Äôs definitely not a home stereo replacement.Overall 3 stars. Good, not great. If it was $150 it would get another star.For the money involved, you should be able to get some kick $&@ equipment. This unit is decent, but severely overpriced. You‚Äôre paying for the Bose name and a big lithium battery. My daughter‚Äôs Bose Soundlink color puts out almost as much wattage and better Bass at 1/3 the cost.I don‚Äôt think that I can justify keeping this unit for what it cost.ProsGreat form factorHandle!Easy setupSuper long batteryGood soundApp connectConsPriceSound quality could be a lot betterVolume limited - easy to cap outNo sound shaping controls","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AHYUW5WTHPVO4V44CXRAT7REJMUQ,1,207,Color: Silver,"June 11, 2021",2021-06-11,2021-06,JBL,JBL Flip 4 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

I had no interest in a single speaker, I already had an altec lansing for that(though the sound is inferior to these). Unfortuntely, the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers. Followed the ""intuitive"" instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately, but to pair two speakers, either for party mode or stereo(you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo) you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode/stereo. It's been 2 weeks and used at least different devices, and I have only managed to get into party mode twice, SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers!!!!! It's also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023/24!!! The sound on these are good for the size, but if they are lacking the most, it's bass, so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition, IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST!!!!!! Disappointed in Bose. I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them, Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built, well crafted, industry standard products, but it's always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product, whether it's material, workmanship, design, or software or all of the above. It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers, but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it's supposed to be created for. DON'T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS!!!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

They are very lightweight, portable, easy to use, and can pair multiple speakers via Bluetooth for full surround sound! Seriously! Download the Bose Revolve + II Soundlink App to control them.

Highly recommend all! üëçI personally like a touch more bass in my music, but these things only weigh about as much as my cell phone for Pete's Sake, so this was completely expected as the rule of thumb is: more bass = more weight, and I wasn't about to order portable speakers that had a little more bass and were going to tire me from just carrying them around everywhere.

RGJL2LCW2HTTR,B08VL5S148,2.0 out of 5 stars Decent but kind of underwhelming,Dalton Friday,2.0,"Its not a good speaker at full volume and you need a decent space for acoustics to get the best sound out of it. I think maybe i was expecting more for the price. If you want something small and compact that has a decent sound to it this is for you. Right out of the box it sounds great at low to mid volume but after that it kind of gets distorted. You can turn the bass down on your phone and it wont do that but kind of defeated the purpose of why i wanted a bose speaker in the first place. if thats what i gotta do then should've just went with JBL or some other brand. Honestly for the price i think there are better options depending on your sound preferences. I like loud with bass and clarity, a hard combination to get right yes i know but thats my preference. The bose color speaker i had didn't have that problem so i had expected more.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2024",AHMBSXHP376OCWCJPHOOLLVATCTQ,1,3,Color: Black,"May 12, 2024",2024-05-12,2024-05,JBL,JBL Flip 4 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

And so here I am reporting on the speaker that I purchased after already sampling it, and yup - I still love it. It's small, easy to move around, insanely loud, and the best part is that it can be controlled with an app. Almost anything with Bluetooth connects to it (your phone, your laptop, tablet, etc.,) so you can stream whatever your favorite streaming service is right to it. If you have more than one Bose speaker, then you can set up something called ""party mode"" and have these or other Bose speakers set up around your house. I didn't need to though. I used this for a get-together, and the music was blaring and could be heard throughout my entire house. This was so worth the purchase, especially for someone like me who does not have ample space for a huge sound system and doesn't want to add surround sound in my house.

R2QGEC3WRQRMLX,B07PXGQC1Q,5.0 out of 5 stars Very practical,renee,5.0,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device.

I use them to listen to my computer while I play music on my stereo in the background. I also don't feel them in my ear which is super nice. Over the ear headphones get too warm and uncomfortable, and in ear earbuds block out sound and get uncomfortable over extended use, so these are perfect. These also stay connected compared to my first ten AirPods which would constantly drop the connection. My only gripe is when I attempt to stream Spotify on my iPhone to my home stereo the AirPods will take over and connect if I am wearing them while using them for the computer, so I have to go back into Spotify on my phone and reconnect it to the stereo. Not the end of the world, but I wish there was a way to prevent that from happening.

R3TGOLM06TTGQ8,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars 100% honest review,James M.,4.0,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted.

R1HA6GWOISYTFN,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Purchased these in Nov 2019 & still going strong,Melanie Hawthorne,4.0,"I bought my 2nd gen Airpods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sounds quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.)Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones).","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGLIW2ME2UMV6MELUQXKQEP6CDLA,1,16,Set: Without AppleCare+,"June 25, 2024",2024-06-25,2024-06,JBL,JBL Charge 3 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R2RXIKIAXE4Z31,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Product,Misagp,4.0,"I tried many cheaper versions of bluetooth earbuds, but they are all touchy and annoyingly glitchy, compared to AirPods, which are just awesome! Pairs perfectly, just as most Apple products do. You can program them to do various things when you tap them, so you don't have to do everything through the phone. The voice recognition is very handy when driving and you need Siri to do something for you. The mic is a little quiet on phone calls, so I cup my hand to my mouth to direct sound to them when needed.After a while though, my left ear is sore from the shape of the earbud. It's probably just my ear shape. Still not interested in paying more for the smaller, more cushy ones. Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous.I recommend getting the little silicone case cover, as it helps you find the item, clip it to your phone, etc. Keep them clean, don't get them wet, don't store them in pockets and lose them. They seem to survive small drops. They do have a feature that makes noise to help you find them, but only if they still have some charge in their batteries.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AFZAUG5S6T5FHORGNTMQHNLQ6HZQ,1,1,Set: Without AppleCare+,"June 22, 2024",2024-06-22,2024-06,JBL,JBL Charge 3 - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Doesn't require Apple users to put in a password or set up an account or any of the other annoying things other wireless ear buds often require. I found them comfortable, similar in feel to my iPhone wired earbuds, and perhaps a little more secure in my ears. They work fine for me while running. Sound is good for an open earbud. My only wish is that there was a way to raise and lower volume manually... perhaps this comes in other Airpod versions. It may take more than one attempt to activate Siri, or start the audio, with the two taps.

But I ordered other Apple or different brands of ear buds, and absolutely none of them felt comfortable in my small ear canals. Even the ones with multiple rubber things small enough to supposedly fit. All of the styles I had to return got far greater reviews for sound quality, and they all allow you to see the amount of battery charge left on the case.These earbuds have so-so sound quality, and I never use them for phone calls. So I can‚Äôt speak about that aspect. The choices of what you can tap on either the left or right side for are limited. Other ear phones or buds have multiple ways you can touch your right and left sides, to get sound levels, on/off, next track, answering phone, etc. The main thing these do is allow you to use Siri, as they are an Apple product, albeit several models ‚Äúold.‚Äù The main drawback to these is that you cannot look at the case to see how much battery charge is left. You must open the case up when your Bluetooth area is open within your phone‚Äôs or iPads‚Äô setting, in order for that to tell you the battery percentage for both the ear buds and the case which can charge them.

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5.0,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2284,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 11, 2022",2022-08-11,2022-08,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5.0,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world‚Äî they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.‚ÄîTHE SOUND‚ÄîBoth the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!‚ÄîCONNECTIVITY‚ÄîThese connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don‚Äôt need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.‚ÄîFIT‚ÄîThe fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)‚ÄîTHE CONTROLS‚ÄîThe controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON‚Ä¶ which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button‚Äî it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.‚ÄîBATTERY‚ÄîThe battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?‚ÄîRANGE‚ÄîVery good, about 30+ feet‚ÄîCONS‚Äî-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn‚Äôt as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds‚Äî these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you‚ÄîUPDATE‚Äîthey have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case‚Ä¶ which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived‚Ä¶ only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,563,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"September 28, 2023",2023-09-28,2023-09,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot.

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4.0,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 3, 2024",2024-08-03,2024-08,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3.0,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it‚Äôs like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it‚Äôs not straight up refusing to connect it‚Äôs disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that‚Äôs a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn‚Äôt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,70,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"May 25, 2024",2024-05-25,2024-05,Beats,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R3W0SAGT4F2CDC,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars decent,Guru,3.0,"On the positive side, the sound quality of these earbuds is impressive. The audio is clear and well-balanced, making them great for listening to music, podcasts, and phone calls. The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless with Android devices, and the quick pairing feature is very convenient. Additionally, the fit is comfortable, and they stay secure during workouts and daily activities.However, there are a few drawbacks that affect the overall experience. Firstly, the touch controls can be overly sensitive and sometimes unresponsive, which can be frustrating when trying to pause, play, or skip tracks. Secondly, the battery life, while decent, doesn‚Äôt quite match up to some competitors in the same price range. I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than I would have liked.Another issue is the lack of noise cancellation. While they do an okay job at passive noise isolation, they struggle in louder environments, which can impact the listening experience in busy settings. Additionally, the absence of volume control on the earbuds themselves is inconvenient, requiring me to use my phone to adjust the volume.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AFZ62B2ONA6QTX6J5M6MRVL7Q3KA,1,1,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds,"June 25, 2024",2024-06-25,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

RDW8UQ9AOCJJ9,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent,Amazon Customer,4.0,"I ordered these for my Pixel 6 Pro because I needed bluetooth headphones quickly, otherwise I would have waited for the new Pro buds that came out a short while after I ordered these.Overall, I like these but I have a few issues.One, all three ear fitting sizes don't work great with the shape of my ear canal, I guess, because they are pushed out and I am constantly pushing them back in. They have almost fallen in the trash, down the sink and in the litter box when I have leaned/bent over. I am not using these buds during physical activity such as running or working out, this is just in the kitchen while cooking or doing household chores. This is inconvenient and aggravating. If I did some research, I am sure I could find other shapes in ear fittings to remedy this issue, and this issue does not reflect on the quality of the headphones themselves.Two, the battery life. For music and talking on the phone, I find the battery life to be as much as one should expect but not as much I would want. I hope the Pro buds have longer battery duration. I use my ear buds everyday, for as little as an hour/2 hours for talking on the phone, or as long for music. I understand not everyone will need to be on the phone as long as I do, but if you were looking for these for working from home or instead of a headset at work, they aren't advisable for that.Three, the noise filter/cancelation. When using in the car, I have had complaints of the road/wind/traffic being louder than my voice to the person am talking to. Also, I have had complaints that noises like doing dishes/opening a bag to add to the trash can is extremely loud to the person on the other end. For noise cancelation, I think it does decent enough but I think the feature the Pro has called Transparency mode where you can fade in/out of cancelation would be more useful.These are comfortable in your ear when they aren't popping out, the sound quality of the music and the voice of the other person on a phone call is great. The voice assistant I haven't used much but it's been very responsive when I have used it. I can't call my husband via voice because he is saved as 'hubby' in my contacts, and when I ask Google to call Hubby, she says, ok what's your husband's name? then can't find him in my phone. Oh well. All in all these headphones are worth getting over off-brands, but I would save for the Pros if I was honest.","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2022",AF7LQSBFPTYESEVB3N3NKS6IM4PA,1,45,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds,"August 19, 2022",2022-08-19,2022-08,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

Used exclusively for gym, elliptical (watching videos on tablet) and running (mostly sprint intervals), with MP3 player, not phone.. I am not listening to violin concertos, just trance/rock music, generally with a fair amount of background noise, so sound quality doesn't need to be concert hall quality. Isolation could be better, but lots of runners don't like isolation for safety reasons. Wing keeps them firmly in place without being uncomfortable to me. Easy to load music, easy to connect to mp3 player and tablet, easy to make Bluetooth connection, no interruptions even when in shorts pocket and running hard. Only thing it lacks from my standpoint is volume control link to mp3 player, find myself sometimes have to grab player and adjust volume (volume variation likely attributable to download variations). I have had such a satisfactory experience with these I have considered upgrading to the Pixel Buds Pros which have touch volume controls, but I worry about them falling out during runs, and also price at 50-100% more, not sure they would be worth it.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AEKZM63RGQN5QMHLQC4ZIUQHV3YA,1,1,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds,"March 1, 2024",2024-03-01,2024-03,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I wish I could switch that off sometimes. Sometimes, I just want a single earbud in! And having to find a place to put the other earbud that triggers the proximity sensor to let things keep playing can be a bit of a hassleThe Bad: if you order them in different colors, say, for yourself and another person, the cases will look very similar.

R2OQM5XLDBPKDP,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They do the job for what I needed,N. Arr,5.0,"I'll be honest, I loose technology....often. As a result I never bought expensive earbuds. I would always buy the $30 and under option because inevitably I was going to misplace them and could not stomach the idea of loosing a $100 item within a few weeks of purchase. However after 3 years of COVID required zoom calls my coworkers chipped in and bought me the Google pixel buds. There was an immediate difference for me in regards to what I could hear and the experience for anyone talking to me on the other side. Here are the highlights1. The noise cancellation works well. In the past people would complain they can't hear me clearly because of all the background noise. As if I were at a construction site when I simply was opening a bag of chips!2. Sound quality is perfect. Can't tell you how many times with other earbuds I would be told can you get closer to the phone, or that I sounded far away, or was I underwater etc etc. But with these it's Crystal clear no issues at all.3. Battery lasts long enough. I find that these last most of my work day. I tend to average about five hours of meetings a day and in that capacity they last.4. Charge speed is quick. When I do need to charge these for from 0-100% in like 20mins. To be fair I don't think I have ever let them get to 0. Overall I don't find myself charging them often and the charging case really does do a good job of charging the actual buds quickly if I do run into a problem.5. Ear buds do slip out. I have found an occasion that a slight tap will accidentally send the earbuds falling out of my ear. I've changed the size of the ear cushion but doesn't really seem to lock in well like other earbuds I have tried. So that is one point off for them but nothing insurmountable that would detract from the overall score.Overall for the price I think these are great. So much so that I did in fact lose the ones my coworker bought me within about 6 weeks and ended up buying my own pair thankfully they were on sale.

R2N6GLU60E0O70,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They're FINE.,Quentin,5.0,"Ok, so I really only bought these because I was curious about the difference between the $10-20 earbuds I was used to using (with no real functional complaints) versus a more expensive, near-premium experience. I had also just bought a Pixel phone, so I figured, what the heck, let's get the ecosystem since I'd never fully done that before (I also bought the Pixel watch). And honestly, while they're fine and the audio is great and the easy connection to a Google phone is convenient, I'm not sure it's $60-80 better than the cheap stuff we buy and replace all the time. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice to have Google assistant on call, handsfree, especially after I've gotten so used to using it at home that I sometimes call out to Google in public places only to catch myself mid ‚ÄùHey Goo-."" But honestly, most earbuds at least allow you to press and call Google or Alexa, so again, my quibble isn't we with the buds being good. They are. But if you're a practical spender like me and also have a tight budget (or just don't want to spend more than you have to), I'd put it like this: these earbuds are more than worth the money if calling Google assistant anywhere, at anytime with just a whisper is super important to you. Otherwise, save a few bucks and get something in the $40-60 range and you'll still get 95% of what comes with these. But if you have the money to spend and don't care too much, yeah, these are fine. They fit fine, they last for a decent amount of time, and the charging case feels premium. But I was a bit underwhelmed after using em for a bit because I guess I expected something that would fundamentally raise my expectations for earbuds moving forward and I don't think these did that. I'll probably still switch between these and my $10 buds from time to time, probably keeping these in the car since the house wired with Google inside.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2022",AGJSG3XDDL5RCKG5D646IJTVF3TA,1,40,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds,"December 8, 2022",2022-12-08,2022-12,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker
RF574C7KF8UQK,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best pair of earbuds/phones I've ever owned,BTC,5.0,"The Pixel Buds are unquestionably the best set of ear-anything I've ever owned. Combined with my Pixel 6 XL, the buds are picked up instantaneously upon being removed from the case. The battery life is excellent and the case holds several additional charges. Thus far I've never run out of a charge. Not even sure I've gone below 75%, honestly.The best part about these, which can't be said for many other buds, is that you don't have to pair them to use them. You can use one of them and then switch over to the other if you want to maximize battery life (or simply don't want to or can't use both at the same time). This feature is often reserved for buds that are much more expensive than these.My final comment - and perhaps the most important - is the fit. Absolutely perfect. I have avoided buds over the years at all costs because I can just never get them to sit right in my ear. They fall out, they hurt, whatever. I do a lot of work around the house and get sweaty (I live in Florida, tough not to be sweaty...) and have had buds just drop out of my ear because of that. Never has that happened yet with these buds. They're so comfortable you can forget they're even in there.Do yourself a favor and pick these up. Top notch all around.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AGBJX6HZBSAZYMTNWHT623RPZMOA,1,19,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds,"September 24, 2023",2023-09-24,2023-09,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R3VEOTHXAN30WJ,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but they don't last long enough and charging can be an issue,the weathered man,3.0,"I've had my Pixel Buds A series for a couple months shy of a year. I've really enjoyed them and use them every day when I'm cooking breakfast. They might get up to 1 hour a day use from me. The sound quality is very good, they are comfortable in the ears, and I like how well they work with my Pixel phone. I like the appearance, charging case and fit/finish of these more than AirPods.Recently the left earbud lost at least 50% of its volume, and is fading more every day. It's the same thing that happens with cheaper wired earbuds after a few months... volume loss, then eventually it stops working all together. So I was disappointed that the same thing seems to be happening with these Pixel buds, which are not cheap earbuds. I take care of my earbuds and keep them clean and free of debris, so that's not the issue. Apparently these aren't built to last. I had expected these to last as long as AirPods, but that's not been my experience.One other issue I've had with them is that often when you place them back in the charging case, they don't charge. Next time you go to put them on, they don't work because they will completely discharge on their own. Apparently there's an issue with the earbud's charging pin making contact with the one in the charging case -- it doesn't always make contact. Thankfully, the case's LED blinks to let you know when it's detected the earbud and is charging it, but you just have to make sure you watch it. It often takes me a few tries before I can get it to work. This has been an issue as long as I've had these. It's only a minor annoyance and I suspect it's a minor design flaw that they'll eventually remedy in manufacturing.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AE6VEADNLEN5YHTMN4MSR6IB75IA,1,19,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds,"September 12, 2023",2023-09-12,2023-09,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I can easily switch from my phone to laptop with ease. The case doubles as a sensory tool during meetings or while out walking. Charging the case takes a minute but it holds a charge well once it's fully charged. I think I've been able to charge my buds 2 or 3 times before needing to charge the case again.Buds seem to last longer during phones calls than meetings (thinks zoom) or listening to music (think YouTube).Noise cancellation is good!

Once again, the Raycons come in first place because they have pretty good ANC.Now you may ask ""If the Raycons are so good, why buy these?""The Raycons are push button and when I want to do things like change songs, I have to push the buttons and it pushes them harder into my ears. Also, the call quality suffers because people in the other end can't hear me very well. With these I never got to the part where I tried the call, but there was no point. If I don't like the audio, the call quality won't matter.These are cheaply priced for a reason.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023",AH3DASADOTFMAVMTKHRFGCBEJQYA,1,1,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds,"August 8, 2023",2023-08-08,2023-08,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

They just feel intuitive and natural. I find them easy to work with.

I haven‚Äôt tested the battery myself yet, but 8-10 hours is A LOT of music!Sound quality-Google nailed it. The sound quality is at least on par with AirPods.

Sound is great for a vast majority of users (but not quite audiophile level) and these have great features. The auto pause when you take them of your ear, google assistant and touch buttons, automatic volume control based on ambient noise are all thoroughly enjoyable and helpful. Definitely make sure you download the app to get the most out of them.I do use them for music, videos, voice, and video calls and have great results with Windows, Mac, and Android. Battery life isn't the most stellar and I do run out of juice when using continuously for 3 to 4 hours between music and calls. But at this point I normally find that my ears need a break anyway and the buds charge rapidly in the case so they have enough juice to keep going by the time I'm ready to throw them in again.I also paired the sage color buds with the leather case from Nomad, and the pairing makes this product look and feel like a luxury product.I can't say how happy I am to have such a large company trending towards making modern tech more affordable. Google really exceeded expectations for me at this price point, and if you wait until they're on sale it feels like an absolute steal.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2022",AFIFQCABCY4W4JD4ZJMHVWEW75LQ,1,22,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds,"December 23, 2022",2022-12-23,2022-12,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

These cost a hundred bucks full price and those usually go below 40 dollars, mind you. Don't buy if you want sound quality or longevity.Otherwise, with the exception of the auto volume depending on the environment noise, the (only couple of) extra features work well, and the mics are okayish. And will work well for going on a run since they sit very tight on the ears if you adjust them correctly.

RTTFYIVPAN2JD,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A great set of Earbuds for a non-premium price,Seth McNew,5.0,"I was kind of skeptical at first when I decided to buy these - there were other earbuds I was considering at the time at around the same price range, and I had a pair of $20 buds at home that were still somewhat working. But, I decided to take a shot and honestly, I'm really surprised with how well these work.Bluetooth communication between the buds and my Pixel 6 have been amazing outside of one weird incident towards the beginning where music was choppy, but a quick restart on my phone fixed that. I've left my phone in my office a few times, and I can get a pretty good distance before noticing dropouts too, so it's nice not to always need the phone on my hip for these to work. Though, these do not support multipoint - afraid if you want to connect to multiple devices at the same time with a Pixel bud, you'll need to step up to the Pixel Buds Pro.Audio quality has been really good as well. I'm no audiophile by any means, but I do listen to a lot of EDM/Techno/Jazz and nothing really sounds muted. There is a setting to do Bass Boost within the Bluetooth settings that silently get installed when pairing the Buds for the first time to your phone, but I've yet to experiment with it. ANC isn't a feature on here, but just the fit of the earbuds do isolate the music to some degree from the world around. And the fit was surprisingly comfortable - the extra wing of support keeps the buds in place well that I rarely have to adjust them.Lastly, I was kind of worried about the battery before purchasing. I'd prefer something that would last my whole work day, and surprisingly, these do! Mind you, I typically only have a single bud in while I'm working because a lot of people walk into my office, but I'll swap buds around lunch time when it starts to get low on battery. They charge quickly - I'd say I could pull out my bud in about 20 minutes to it being mostly, if not fully charged. From this, I'd say I get about a week's worth of battery charge with the case.My only major complaint is that I hate that there's no tactile buttons on the buds themselves. You have to tap the G on your earbuds to bring up the Assistant, stop/play music, etc. but sometimes I'll be tapping all around the bud just trying to find that sweet spot because touch detection can be a little iffy. But, compared to my previous earbud set, this is a significant upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AEJOJYUEQYWVBUETOZOM4Q3UCELQ,1,55,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds,"September 22, 2022",2022-09-22,2022-09,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

I have a pair of sony wf-1000xm4s that i use at work and those sound truly incredible with the anc on and while these dont have anc i would say they do sound impressive when turned up louder and the eq is perfect for the music i listen to. the case is also great and i love the shape. and the battery is great also. ive only had to change them once since i got them a few weeks ago.i love these things as an everyday carry. they look great, sound great, and work great. if you use android you should really look into these.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AG2YCANG4QZKMQRWOVHTWALISVBA,1,48,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds,"March 24, 2023",2023-03-24,2023-03,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

RB54OKL32JRKE,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Wireless Showdown: Pixel Buds in the Ring,Heather A. Turner,5.0,"Venturing into the realm of the Google Pixel Buds, I embarked on a journey of exploration that spanned across platforms, including iPhone and Windows computer usage. This review aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the capabilities of these wireless earbuds, in comparison to other popular options. To be honest I tried them out because they were on supersale during Prime Day. So why not!The Pixel Buds shine brightly in several aspects. Their design, minimalistic and comfortable, ensures a snug fit suitable for both workouts and daily activities. The sound quality, characterized by crisp audio and punchy bass, impressed me across a variety of musical genres. Google's adaptive sound feature, dynamically adjusting volume based on surroundings, further enhanced the listening experience.As an iPhone user I love Airpods but they are pretty pricey. Speaking of alternatives, let's talk about the AirPods. The Pixel Buds stack up well in terms of sound quality and the real-time translation feature, giving them a distinct edge. I have found the battery to be pretty good and have not had to recharge nearly as often as my Airpod Pros.Considering the AirPods, while they integrate seamlessly with Apple devices, the Pixel Buds' compatibility with different platforms is a plus. Additionally, the Pixel Buds' noise canceling and translation capabilities broaden their appeal beyond audio quality alone.To sum it up, the Google Pixel Buds offer a solid package. Their design, audio quality, and innovative features position them as strong contenders in the wireless earbud market. Though a few minor drawbacks exist, they deliver an enjoyable audio journey. Whether you lean towards the Google ecosystem or seek versatile wireless earbuds with modern touches, the Pixel Buds are well worth your consideration. So I say, if they are on SUPERSALE give them a spin!","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2023",AECN7SQ3TVCMIAG2JRVPSNGZE5WQ,1,61,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds,"August 19, 2023",2023-08-19,2023-08,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R3S40TUBFPM6RV,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars These are marginally good,Signalsoldier,3.0,"When they work, they work well. Here are a list of my complaints- The stay connected to the phone after placing them in the pod. The contact sensors may not be extended far enough from the inside of the case to contact the earphones to disconnect and charge. I often have to press them firmly into their holes before closing the lid.- They often take forever to connect after pulling them from the case. Sometimes not at all. You have to place them inside, close the lid and reopen and pull them out several times before they connect.- They've gotten lower in sound over time. After about 30 days the left bud is noticeably lower than the right. For seemingly no reason.I've had 3 different set of Pixel buds and they've all fell victim to the above complaints.

RQX6424R8MXGA,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding but limited performance,fernando,4.0,"From the reviews and price I was on the fence. I decided to bite the bullet and buy these mostly because of the price and that they are Google like my 7 pro. I've had several buds favorite being a pair of Bose that are discontinued, sounded great connected easily and after several years and my sweat , maybe not cleaning them better, they are pretty beat up. Still working but controls have fallen off hahah. Ok back to the review, issues trying to hang up a call , can't ever tell unless I'm staring at my cell, should have some sort of confirmation sound or something.Additionally, Not having a separate app for them is where I feel it's a unfulfilling and limited experience. You can't tailor the sound, they are not very loud; obviously buds would not be safe to use if too loud but my other buds both Bose still sound better only slightly because the difference in volume, the Google buds do shine when talking fidelity. I have some other less known over the head headphones and earbuds by Soundcore which sounds good but these are super clear just no adjustments. I download an equalizer app which helps.I can live with most of these small shortcomings since they were not very expensive but for 100 dollars I would have like better controls , better fit. I have the same fit issues as other reviews have mentioned. I don't like over the ear buds with the little accessories to hold in place so I stick with this type. The other ones I have which are the Bose beat up and all from sweat and the Soundcore earbuds fit much better. Google little case is annoying too, should have come with a little cord to secure the charging case or at least a less slippery material for the surface, Im always feeling I'm going to lose it at the gym or anywhere. Still think of returning them but trying to work with them cause although the are not very loud they do sound great. Battery life still have not used enough ,earbuds weight would probably help if they were a bit heavier would help with fit and about range, not too sure yet.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AEU2OFD3HFVEF4LXEUMV4TJ6GQLA,1,1,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Bluetooth Speaker

But only a month after buying them they will only auto connect to my phone when I pulled them out of the case about 25% of the time the rest of the time I have to go into settings and manually connect them. And now they‚Äôve gotten to where when I get it to say they‚Äôre connected, it makes the chime in the earbud like it is but zero sound or anything comes through either of the earbuds and I‚Äôm at the point where I have to go through customer support center to try to do something with it what a pain.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AFRPZNJRR3NV44G2IXPB555VUWXQ,1,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,"July 31, 2024",2024-07-31,2024-07,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

At $80 i think they are a bit at the top, lacking noise cancelling and ambient mode where the market now has solid options at the price from known brands(soundcore, skullcandy,ect).Pros- Extremely Portable- very good battery life on the buds(18 hours!)- USB C caseCons- sound ( they are heavily tuned towards the mid range and high end, make the music very tight and thin)-the fit( ones they are in there, they have a very strong suction)- button controls( they will jam into your ear when you use them).Honestly its hard to recommend the buds, to most they will sound good enough to get the job done, its just really tough to move these even at that $80 priceMe personally, i will most likely send them back as i own the beats fit pro, which easily outperform these(as they should for $199).If you still want beats, I‚Äôll look into the studio buds instead, much fuller sound and have ANC and ambient mode.

There is no indicator light anywhere on the case that would give a clue about the status of the pairing, battery etc. Pairing supposed to work simply by opening the lid near your phone. Nothing happened when I opened it (other than a low level sound effect coming from the case. I did charge it, so that should not be the problem.) Then I tried pairing manually but the device does not show up anywhere among the paired devices or list of devices available to pair. Then I tried following the instructions on their dedicated product page. For Android it says that one should download the Beats App from the Play store. And so I did, but this specific model, SOLO BUDS, is not listed as an available product to pair.

R2OL6WGA32OZ1,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Middle-of-the-road earbuds in a small case,Dave Gilbert,3.0,"I had high hopes for these given the brand reputation - Beats are a well-established partner for Apple and are supposed to be good for listening to music. Beats are known to be particularly good for bass-heavy music; I have a pair of Beats over ear headphones and they are decent. These earbuds however do not live up to the reputation.Pros:* I was excited to see how small the case is for these earphones. It is significantly smaller and lighter than the typical Apple airpods case, for example. I ordered in the translucent red and it is a cool look. I like being able to see the electronics within the case (the buds are solid color red).* the form factor and related design of the buds is excellent. They are covered in a rubberized material typical for sports electronics, making them water and sweat resistant as well as mostly impervious to dirt. the fit in the ear is really good, and they come with multiple sets of ear tips in matching color. They do not fall out of my ear despite use during sports / exercise.* sound quality for phone use is very good. I can hear well and callers can hear me. They hold up to reasonable background noise.* sound quality for podcasts and other spoken word is also good. I can hear clearly and volume is sufficient.* iphone integration is decent. The earbud controls appear on iphone in a similar fashion to airpods.* battery life is good. I would estimate 10-12 hrs on a single charge.* they come with a 1-year warrranty from Apple (as documented in the product guide)Cons:*sound quality with music is only so-so. I was frankly disapointed. They do not hold up well in an A-B comparison with my Apple Airpod Pros (2nd generation) - a decent Mid-Fi option. In my opinion these are unsuitable for listening to music.* no case battery. The reason the case is so much smaller is because the case itself cannot charge the ear buds without being plugged in. I guess this is ok since the battery life on the ear buds is very good compared with others, but it was a surprise to me.* missing my favorite airpod feature - automatic pause. On my airpods, if I take one out of my ear the source pauses. Seems like a missed opportunity given the existing integration.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFQNCPIKKEK67YQSJQXF2UKQML4A,0,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
R1LERTLVVTROBV,B0D3JB14QS,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Solo Buds: Compact Sound Titans in a Budget-Friendly Package,JAYSIN,4.0,"The Beats Solo Buds are a testament to the brand's **continued attention to sound quality**, delivering an auditory experience that impresses at its price point. While they may lack a battery within the case, reducing the overall listening time, the buds themselves offer an **excellent battery life**. In testing, they lasted just shy of **17.5 hours**, though individual results may vary slightly. Their portability is a significant advantage, making them a convenient choice for on-the-go music enthusiasts.It's true, the absence of an **IP rating** for water and sweat resistance, along with the lack of noise canceling or spatial audio features, might be seen as downsides. However, these omissions are somewhat mitigated by the buds' affordability. The removal of the indicator light, a seemingly small feature we've all come to rely on, is a curious choice by Apple. It's akin to a phone without a camera; it functions, but something feels amiss. Now, users must rely on their phones to check the battery life and confirm if the charging cable is properly connected. For iPhone users, this information is conveniently displayed via an on-screen card, while Android users can find it in the app.Despite these quirks, the Beats Solo Buds strike a balance between **size, sound quality, and price** that many will find just right. For those seeking alternatives, the Soundcore Space A40 offers a similar size, more overall battery life, a wireless charging case, and comparable sound quality with a bit more sub-bass impact. They also boast a comfortable fit with ANC and an actual **IPX4 rating**, all at a price point that's often under $50 on sale, available in black, blue, and white‚Äîall of which are quite stylish. Ultimately, the Beats Solo Buds stand out for their portability and sound quality, making them a worthy consideration for those prioritizing these features within this price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AER7PTMSQZFO5CNGSYDORW6DEDGQ,0,6,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,"June 22, 2024",2024-06-22,2024-06,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
RRUPVKNOMLTLD,B0D3JB14QS,4.0 out of 5 stars These are great earbuds with a portable small case,Tracy,4.0,After hearing a lot of great things about Beats products I expected better. These paired easily and quickly with my phone and come with a great slim carry case which also keeps the earbuds charged. They also come with various ear tips so you can customize the fit. They stay in my ears even if I shake my head hard so that's good too. I still prefer earbuds with a silicone piece that locks them into my ears though. Mostly what I don't like about these is the sound quality. There is just something off about the sound. It has this distant quality to it that seems strange. The EarFun earbuds I purchased in 2021 cost $20 less and the sound quality is far superior. They also still hold a charge and function just as well now as they did 3 years ago.

R3KI9GNXUTY8X4,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't live up to the brand name,Cheesy,3.0,"TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality. Expensive.Beats has really made a name for itself as a brand and is considered a higher end option for sound. When I received this pair of earbuds, my impression was that it sounds the same as my skullcandy buds... For a brand that advertises itself as being a first choice for music buffs who are invested in quality sound, I couldn't tell much of a difference. There is no EQ setting to tinker with in an app like I've seen in some other earbuds that market themselves as musically superior. In fact, the Beats app seems to only exist to show you adds for more Beats.But, I am not picky about my earbuds. I usually pick based on pricing, comfort, and convenience over sound quality. That being said, these buds fit in the ear much easier AND more comfortably than the skullcandy ones I've used in the past. They are extremely comfortable and do not fall out. The case (transparent red) is very attractive and slim and the lid doesn't fly open accidentally to make you risk losing a bud.Ultimately, they are better than previous earbuds I've used, but only in comfort and fit, not in sound. I don't know if I'd shell out an extra $40 for these just for a more comfortable fit vs. the $39.99 competitor.TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality.

If that is your expectation too, then get ready to be disappointed as I was. The sound on these is not great and really falls flat. The range is just poor, and I can't find any way to adjust it in the app.At $80 I guess I can't complain about it too much, but I thought I was sacrificing things like a battery in the case not actual sound performance.The fit is ok, but multiple times they have fallen out while using on the elliptical and the controls are hard to use because they are physical buttons that force movement of the bud when pressing. On the plus side you don't accidentally pause your music when readjusting like the touch sensitive ones do.Personally, I don't see these as being a daily driver. I think I will throw them in my travel bag so if I forget to pack or don't have room for my primaries, I at least have something.Overall, I don't recommend these, there are much better options in this price range, beats really missed the mark on this release!","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHY5C3OQ4B5WHDQSIPWGFTRCPV2Q,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo Buds,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

They represent Beats' approach to minimalist function, design, but kind of miss the mark.These buds are small. You do have several options of sizing for yours ears, but once those things are in, you want to be careful operating the touch controls as each slight tap feels as though you may be pushing them further into your ear canals.Sound wise, I wasn't too impressed. The highs/mids were decent, but the bass seemed lacking a bit compared to other buds that I've used. I can't really say much on the ANC as I didn't really need it. With enough volume, everything outside was pretty much muted...typical of this style of earbud.There was an app that requested to download that allowed for manipulation of some features, but having to install an app and give up permissions can often be concerning.For phones conversations, these weren't bad. You could hear someone on them pretty well, though I found myself sometimes asking others to speak up a bit or having to turn up my volume.

R3CG9KMYIHUOFI,B0D3JB14QS,1.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre sound; lacking features; works with iPhone,Anne Swan,1.0,"This is a very disappointing product from Beats. I've had the fantastic Power Beats Pro ear buds with ear hooks and lots of features for a couple years, so I expected more from this product--even at the low price point. First, the positive features: they were easy to pair with my iPhone 15 Pro Max. They also came with some charge; they do hold a charge for a long time and charge up quickly. The built in microphone worked for phone calls. The best feature was that the XS ear tips fit my small ear canal; I've not ever had an ear bud type that actually staying in my ear before--a first! The translucent red case and the red earbuds are attractive. The small case is portable, but frankly, I have no problem taking my slightly larger Power Beats Pro case anywhere I need it.Now, for the other aspects: The ""selling"" feature of this is its small size. Frankly, it makes it harder to maneuver, to get the buds out of the case and into ears. But most importantly, the sound is mediocre or less. There is no noise cancelling, and for some reason I have the volume setting on my iPhone turned as high as it will go and the sound on the earbud is at a low volume. Why won't the volume increase as typical speakers or headphones? Turns out I need some unnamed app to control the volume. But the instructions don't name the app. Also, I was unable to locate the app in the Apple App store. All I could find was an app for Beats Pill.As others have mentioned, the sound is in the high and mid-range--so the base is missing in the rock music and the classical music I prefer. I've had sound this ""good"" from cheap wired pairs. I would have liked some indication of which is right and left. The buds are very small, and I find it tricky to align them in the proper way to get them in the case. There is no noise cancelling feature; other offerings around this price point offer that. Also, this doesn't come with a cable or plug. I happen to have several USB-C cables and plugs, but if you don't have one, there's another expense. AIn my opinion, the positive features don't overcome the poor sound quality and the lack of noise cancelling. These do not make listening fun. I cannot recommend this product.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AE2YL4P67J4E3A5T6LTRUHF4VERQ,0,1,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,"July 1, 2024",2024-07-01,2024-07,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

They also are not that loud and when you consider they don't have NC or a battery in the case it's just an all around bad purchase. These sound like some $30 earbuds that I own. On the pro side they are small and the case is beautiful but not having a battery is kind of weak It honestly seems like Beats has different teams working on their earbuds and headphones. The two recent headphones (solo 4 and studio pro) have been really good and all of their wireless earbuds have been bad.

Boofer,1.0,"I was excited to see something from a recognized brand become available through the Vine program. But that excitement was quickly replaced with disappointment.Let's talk about the few positives. To my surprise, they fit really well in my ears and felt secure. Just looking at them, I figured the fit would be an issue, but they fit my ears great. The sound of them when working properly was pretty good and they offer pretty impressive bass response for ear buds. This is unfortunately where the positives end.As marks on the negative side, the buttons on the side of the earbuds you can use to perform different functions are terrible. They are hard to find even when you know where they are and you have to press on them way too firmly to get them to work. I don't really want to have to shove the earbud halfway to my brain to depress the button. For the price point, you would expect noise cancellation and ambient mode. Nope, like Charlie Sheen they have one speed. Onto the most damning aspect, the left earbud quit working after only about 10 uses. That's right, 10 uses. I have had ear buds that cost less than half that outlasted these by years.Beats is a name that should be synonymous with quality. These miss the mark from what I would be looking for from them in so many ways. Put it this way, I plan to try and return them despite receiving them free through the Vine program.

I can promise you, you will regret it as soon as you put them on.The size is way too small, even though they are pretty comfortable.

R3ACA4BFELO1SS,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Apple/Beats is walking a middle line with these,This Is Not,3.0,"I've been using these the last couple of days as my everyday drivers. I have tried Beats earbuds before, mainly the Studio Buds and the Studio Buds+. Neither stayed in my ears without relying on foam ear tips. So, I never fully switched to them and returned them for other products. I have a pair of old PowerBeats Pro, but I stopped using them a while back because they don't have ANC and rely on Lightning for charging (which should be a sin in 2024). I've always wanted to like the Studio Buds and Buds+ due to their design and overall solid build, but they never stayed in my ears.The same holds true with the Solo Buds. They're just like the Studio Buds+, just a little smaller and lighter. If the Studio Buds/Buds+ didn't stay in your ears, these ones won't either. I went through all the different ear tip sizes and medium fit me the best, but I had to push the right earbud back into my ear every hour or so.While I had these in my ears, I was able to do some listening. They popped up on my iPhone 15 Pro Max like all other Beats and Apple earbuds/headphones. You get some options in the iOS settings and the drop down menu. Unlike AirPods, these do not feature head tracking for spatial audio (though they do work with spatial audio, so does ANY pair of earbuds or headphones) or any ANC whatsoever. The charging case does not have a battery in it either. These earbuds last for about 17 hours (Apple advertises 18 hours) when I listened to them at about 75% volume.One thing that took me back was just how quiet these were. I had the same issue with the Studio Buds+. I have Soundcheck turned on in Apple Music due to listening to Atmos/Spatial tracks. It turns up their volume to match the volume of other tracks in my library while normalizing track volumes across the board. Still, I have other earbuds and headphones from Sony, Moondrop, and Heavys that don't require my iPhone's volume set to 75% for comfortable listening.Although the battery life is exceptional, charging these is a pain. Like I said, the case doesn't have a battery in it which means you need to be near a power source to recharge these. The case doesn't have a charging indicator light, so you don't know the charging state of the earbuds. Are they full, half, or somewhere between? I don't know, you need to lift their lid to find out. The bottom of the case is flat, just like Sony's case for their WF-1000XM5 earbuds (my everyday pair after I test others). It works for Sony because the case supports Qi charging. The Solo Buds case is begging to have a Qi charger in it. That would have helped immensely with the charging situation. Plop them on a Qi charger with an indicator light and wait for it to turn off. At least then you could tell when the earbuds were fully charged.But nope, Apple cut corners here and the case's only purpose is to take power from the back USB-C port and pipe it to the prongs connecting to the earbuds.Overall, the sound quality is fine, albeit very generic. Bass isn't boosted, neither are trebles. I would say this is a slight V-shaped curve, but not much. People expecting a bass boosted profile should know that these fit in the current Beats sound signature of things being flatter and more accurate. It's a little baffling given the history of Beats and that most people, especially those buying mainstream audio products, like a V-shaped sound signature with boosted lows and highs.I listened to modern pop, some metal, hard rock, and dubstep. It all sounded fine. Details were there, but not as much as my Sony WF-1000XM5. But I expected that given the price difference between these and the Sony earbuds (they MSRP for over 4X as much). There isn't wear detection or anything else fancy. Microphone quality is fine, it works but they do let in more outside noise than I'm used to. There isn't any special microphone noise cancelling like with other earbuds. If there is, I'm not hearing it.The biggest reason why I gave these 3 stars and not more is because, compared to other earbuds, these are far too expensive and should be in the $30 price range. Take the Soundcore A40 earbuds. They MSRP for $80 but are routinely on sale for $60 (sometimes even $50). They have less battery life, ""only"" 10 hours compared to 18. But that 10 hour battery life is while using ANC. It isn't the best ANC, but it's ANC nonetheless and that's something the Solo Buds do not have.The Soundcore A40 also have a companion app letting you adjust the EQ to your liking. It isn't an advanced EQ, but it's better than nothing and I think they sound much better than the Solo Buds. They aren't as quite and my iPhone sits at about 40-50% volume instead of 75% for comfortable listening (not even loud listening). The Soundcore A40 have a case featuring a battery and you can recharge the earbuds 4 more times. Their case also features Qi and USB-C charging with an indicator light. You know the rough battery percentage for the earbuds without popping the lid open. You can place the A40 case on a Qi charger and it will recharge both the case and earbuds without issues.For $20 less (right now), you can get a much better pair of earbuds from Soundcore/Anker that have more features and better sound quality. They don't have a fancy animation when you open them next to your iPhone or Android phone, but you get so much more out of them.Honestly, if Apple put a $30 price sticker on these, I would fully recommend them. You're getting neutral sounding earbuds with some smart features (mainly pairing and automatic spatial audio on iPhones). For $30, it's fine to miss a few features like wear detection and the lack of a battery in the charging case. But, at their current full MSRP (or even down to $50), these just aren't worth it, not for the compromises. If you really need to stick with the Beats brand, I think the Beats Flex are a better buy because they include an Apple chip (better iPhone compatibility) and you can put wing tips on them without ruining their compatibility with a charging case.I've also found the microphone quality to be better with the Beats Flex, it's probably because the microphone is closer to your mouth. I also think the Beats Flex sound better. They're still missing tons of smart features, but they're also often available for $50. They also have a charging indicator light.Honestly, I'm not sure what Apple was thinking with these at their full MSRP. You're paying for a little popup on your iPhone/Android and the Beats name, nothing more. Save money and go with Soundcore/Anker for better earbuds and an overall better package. Either that or, if you really want Beats, get the Beats Flex or wait for these to drop down to $35. They aren't worth more than that.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHIDDYIZWNSZJVM4NNK5Y3ISPKAQ,0,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,"June 25, 2024",2024-06-25,2024-06,Sony,Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Tested them out.If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don‚Äôt work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one.You‚Äôd have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I‚Äôve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it‚Äôs strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it.I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4K up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder.Lowering the 4K will add more bass and lower the voice.I‚Äôve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL.My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themself are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me.I did notice someone had posted a review regarding the EQ, I‚Äôve used their EQ style and it flattens the bass and does not give you the bass you want.

R10T5CDIG6Q5UX,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Top quality audio after a few adjustments,P. Dobrinen,5.0,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHY4E66OMDCFPZWPUF5YLKKGZBHA,1,1022,Color: White,"October 21, 2023",2023-10-21,2023-10,Jabra,JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless Earbuds

So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually have good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these.First I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other ""hear through"" type features if you don't want to block out all noise. Really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone. And is really when I need to hear people talking etc.With that said, the fit isn't great, I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor.They are also difficult to get out of the case, the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier.The battery life is ok, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case.

R35BXIWKSFPRAE,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars JBL Vibe Beam | nice,SM Family Reviews,5.0,"The JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless Earbuds have completely exceeded my expectations! As an avid music lover, I'm always on the lookout for earbuds that deliver exceptional sound quality, and these earbuds absolutely deliver. The JBL Deep Bass Sound technology truly lives up to its name, providing rich, immersive audio that brings my music to life. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls on the go, the sound clarity and depth are unparalleled.One of the standout features of these earbuds is their Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, which ensures a seamless and stable connection with my devices. I've never experienced any lag or dropouts, even when moving around in busy urban environments. Plus, the water and dust-resistant design give me peace of mind, knowing that my earbuds are protected against the elements during workouts or outdoor adventures.Comfort is also a priority for me when it comes to earbuds, and the JBL Vibe Beam doesn't disappoint. The ergonomic design and multiple ear tip options ensure a secure and comfortable fit, even during extended listening sessions. And with the hassle-free touch controls, I can easily adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with just a tap.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless Earbuds. They combine top-notch sound quality, reliable connectivity, and comfort in a sleek and durable package. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a fitness fanatic, or simply someone who values convenience and quality in their audio accessories, these earbuds are sure to impress.

R259538LWZP8AS,B0BQPNMXQV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Sound Quality, Very Comfortable and Secure!",Andrew P.,5.0,"Excellent Bluetooth earbuds for the price ($39.95 at the time of purchase and review, list price of $49.95) but I would have been just as happy paying the list price had I not purchased these on discount.The sound quality is surprisingly good. The 'JBL Headphones' smartphone app is highly recommended as using the app will allow you to switch to and from audio and video mode. Audio mode has better sound quality and video mode syncs the sound to the video. Honestly, I don't really notice a enough difference in sound quality between the two modes so I tend to keep it in video mode so I can switch between listening to Pandora or watching YouTube without having to open the app and switch modes.The fit is very comfortable and secure in my ears. I haven't used these for working out yet but I feel like I could go jogging or hit the gym and not have to worry about losing them. I found the default medium-sized cushions to be just right for me, but included in the box are smaller and larger cushions for people with different sized ears.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AF7U35M45QHBH26AM3ZRGIEUUIMA,1,4,Color: Black,"June 27, 2024",2024-06-27,2024-06,Jabra,JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless Earbuds
R3DJJKW7VWLK28,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Fit,Michael,5.0,I read a lot of these reviews most are good mine is as well I bought these to replace my Beats. I was very impressed they are actually better than my $150 Beats were. Sound is amazing the adjustable equalizer makes getting the perfect sound for your needs easy. They fir in the ear good they ate comfortable and don't fall out like my Beats did. They are a little hard to remove from the case but that's actually a good thing I know ppl complained about that but it also means they are harder to just fall out. Another complaint was about the case being too slippery and getting scratched up easily. My Beats case was more slippery and all cases gets scratches eventually so far I haven't gotten any on these. The battery life is also a huge selling point. I'm not disappointed at all.

R3GKU4H3B5RNTI,B0BQPNMXQV,4.0 out of 5 stars excellent battery life. lots of good feature ideas that don't really work IRL.,Mavev,4.0,"When i purchased these I didn't know about the touch controls features. so if you touch one of them it will pause what you are listening to or if you touch the other it can adjust the volume depending on where you tap it. it's very sensitive and I find anything that touches it, hair or hat will pause your podcast. You can turn this feature off with the app. The ""find my buds"" feature in the app for this is great in theory, but pretty useless in real life practice. (I lost one of them a week after owning them.) unless they are currently on and bluetooth connected to the phone with the app you can't make it ping the bud and make a sound to find it. so despite knowing where I lost the bud and knowing i was in range I couldn't find it. So i now have one earbud.The sound quality is good but the noise cancelling isn't capable of cancelling out a mower or a weed wacker enough for you to hear what you were listening to clearly. the pass through sound feature isn't really useful either, on this scale the mic quality just isn't good enough to do that and not have people sound like old robots. It does work.. it just makes everything sound like an old mono radio broadcast.The battery life is really the best feature of these buds. I can listen for 5 hours straight and not have to put it back on the charger. I only listen to podcasts on my single remaining ear bud, maybe if you listened to something with more bass it would drain faster. but for my purposes it's perfect. I also really like that the app shows you the remaining battery percentage of each bud","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGF33BYGZ466FJY2FSXV2CY77JLA,1,6,Color: Black,"June 3, 2024",2024-06-03,2024-06,Jabra,JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless Earbuds

There is a slight audio delay between video and audio, and the audio quality is just not that great, but I am assuming that‚Äôs apple‚Äôs doing for using a non apple product with their phone. I used to use these with a samsung product and they were awesome, liked em a lot. I mostly plan to use these to just listen to stuff, not really watch and listen, so imma keep em because screw apple. If google can make youtube worse on non chrome browsers, im sure apple can affect a device by making the quality a bit worse and purposefully putting in a delay.One month use update: my only real complaint is that they are kind of hard to put away quickly. It takes concentration because you have to rotate them before you put them away, and I have fumbled/dropped them fairly regularly when I am trying to put it away in a hurry or without looking at it. Its hard if you‚Äôre trying to put them away with anything else in your hands like a pen, book, bag/purse, sunglasses etc.The charging case could be improved if they made it so that you didn't have rotate them after you took them out of your ears in order to put them away, and if they made the stems completely rounded so that they rotated smoothly.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AH3DCSUNI7EEVZQZDKXXSYSKTABQ,1,9,Color: White,"June 27, 2024",2024-06-27,2024-06,Jabra,JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless Earbuds

R3DAOPJS3S05AZ,B0BQPNMXQV,4.0 out of 5 stars Great phone call quality and great sound but....,David F,4.0,"Unfortunately the battery life is terrible. I work as a service advisor at a large dealership. I use the right ear peice only most of the time so I can clearly hear customers and technicians, but still hear and receive messages and calls. I love how clearly I can hear people on phone calls and how well they can hear me. Unless I'm in the back shop with the loud noises from the mechanics (of course). I only get about a half of a work day before I hear the friendly female voice say ""battery low"", and I'm forced to put the right one back in the charging case and switch to the left, which is not preferable as I use my left ear to answer the work phone.My only other negative is that you can't use the find my feature if they're in the case. The other evening as I was emptying my pockets to go to bed I noticed they were missing. It turns out they fell out of my pocket while home TV and it it took me a while to find them. It would've been nice to be able to find them quicker.On the positive side though.I love the ambient aware feature so I really can have conversations without taking them out.They are comfortable and stay in my ears even on my 7 mile bike ride home after work.The sound quality for videos and music are great, no complaints there.When these die or I lose them I'll definitely stay with JBL.

R2BSZ7C5UUTNAA,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Way better than airpods,Emily,5.0,"I‚Äôve had a couple different generations of AirPods as well as numerous other brands of wireless earbuds (including JBL Tune which I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of). I was looking into getting the AirPods Pro again, but decided I just didn‚Äôt want to spend that much money. After some research I ended up choosing JBL Vibe Beam and felt fairly comfortable with my decision because I am a fan of JBL. I do not regret it at all. They are better than AirPods by far - piece of advice get the ‚ÄúJBL Headphones‚Äù app. The earbuds automatically come on the Jazz setting so I could see how someone wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied. You can change the equalizer (I used one of the top picture reviews and copied how they had theirs, but they also have other presets). I listen to a lot of Rap, Metal Alternative, etc. so bass is a huge thing for me and using the equalizer was a game changer. The sound is so clear and the bass is amazing. This is probably the most satisfied I‚Äôve ever been with an earbud purchase. It‚Äôs also super easy to connect them. The name showed up right away so the total process maybe took 10-15 seconds to pair them for the first time, which is pretty rare.

I've paid twice the price before and not been nearly this impressed. They bring a new clarity of sound to some albums in which I gave been previously disappointed, eg Clockwork Angels, which has always sounded muddy, even on my custom home sound system. My music tastes have a wide range; whether classical, big band jazz, prog rock, shoe gazer, etc, these buds really deliver for the price. With the app, there is good ability to adjust the sound and other settings, which is very nice, if not unique to JBL.However, there is one big caveat. With all the ear buds I have used over the years, I have never, EVER had such a pain-in-the-*$$ time getting these damn things out of their charging case!! They are stupidly hard to grasp-- they sit deep in the case, don't have a good way to grab them, and the lid very much is in the way of trying to get to them. If you buy these, know you have to be very careful and deliberate about removing them from the case or you will definitely drop them and ultimately ruin them. And if you have big fingers, seriously consider another product...unless you just get a kick out of being extremely frustrated.JBL, if you're listening (sorry for the pun), redesign the case so the ear buds rest in them 180 degrees from the way they do now, increase the surface area to pull them out, and please, PLEASE, redesign the case to have the lid flip farther back out of the way so that people with even average- sized fingers can get to these ear buds!","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AE6VVSQDU46YIRETGGOOQT3EQPDA,1,7,Color: Black,"February 10, 2024",2024-02-10,2024-02,Jabra,JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless Earbuds

I agree they sound pretty good for the price. They're not Bose, but we're talking ear buds. The Bose that I listened to were almost130 more and the difference wasn't enough to justify the cost. Just a tip, but if you get a little water on your finger and rub it around ear tip it should solve or at least help the problem with a loose tips.

I recommend trying sound cancellation, ambient sound and music with each of the silicone tips to find the potential of hearing aids.

R3CDU9S5XF66XB,B0C1QWWZR4,3.0 out of 5 stars Low-end Offerings,NORMAN GARCIA,3.0,"Purchased these JBL Tune Buds a few weeks ago as I had misplaced my Javbra 5 Buds and needed a quick and inexpensive replacement.Here are my observations:Fit - I am of average ear size (I think). I tried all three sizes of bud that came with the packaging. The medium size fit best but by best, I mean just adequate. The silicon buds were cheap feeling and lacked any stiffness that might have helped secure them better to my ear and helped/assisted the ANC when turned on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) - I live in a metropolitan area that is chronically loud. If you live in a quieter area, these might work for you. For me, the ANC is poor to adequate and I suspect the ill fitting bud plays into this factor.Software - I feel the software is mediocore at best. I use these buds for playing music and for remote meetings via MS TEAMs. Once the TEAMs meeting starts the software deactivates ANC and you are able to hear the ""ambient' sounds from your surrounding environment. I can hear the meeting participants fine but they complain that they have trouble hearing me. They tell me that the barely hear my voice and instead hear the noise around me. Not sure of the logic making this ""auto ANC off"" for meetings a thing with the buds/software. Ultimately, I just listen and don't offer much feedback because it ends up being a distraction.Talk - On individual calls, friends and family hear me fine.Meetings - not recommended for meetings as the software is set to turn off ANC once a meeting begins.Gaming - I feel that young people could use these phones to game if they are in a quiet setting like their room.Price - I feel that these JBL Tune Buds were priced adequately around $50.Final Thoughts - If you are willing to pay $25 more I recommend Jabra 5 buds. Your ears will thank you for it.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AFXEN64KEEJBIHRI5VNC3X77ZHQA,1,3,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,"December 8, 2023",2023-12-08,2023-12,JBL,JBL Tune Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

R1PM8XR6N66HJO,B0C1QWWZR4,5.0 out of 5 stars Mastering Engineer Approved,Jenn,5.0,"A lot of pros with one con.I didn‚Äôt think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt used my Airpods since buying these!‚Äù so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc. I can‚Äôt actually remember all of the problems at this point. BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it‚Äôs Black Friday and I bite on these because they‚Äôre on sale. I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars. Turns out average reviews aren‚Äôt everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they‚Äôre comfortable, and the sound is amazing. As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble. These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ‚Äôd. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync‚Äôing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It‚Äôs not a huge deal - it‚Äôs easy to pop them in for a split second if they‚Äôve timed out or something. But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case. I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL‚Äôs part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I‚Äôm doing my part to raise it. In everyday life it‚Äôs not that big of a deal unless you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AFO7HNFRBAYYCEYUNPA4KKJ3ZWTA,1,104,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,"January 12, 2024",2024-01-12,2024-01,JBL,JBL Tune Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

These JBL Tune buds produce a good sound with my iPhone, especially when using the JBL app which has preset equalizer settings for different sounds and can deliver amazing base. Overall these are fairly good earbuds at a sale price of around $50. The box includes 3 pairs of silicon tips, small, medium and large, the silicon material is too smooth and too thin, they slide out easily and do not sit very securely for me, but this is very subjective and can be different for everyone. The noise canceling is only ok, in my opinion it provides about 40-50% background noise cancelation (personal opinion, not scientifically measured). The sound quality is very good but it seems the volume level seems low compared to other buds I have. The microphone seems to function well, I have not heard complaints from people I have called so I assume it is good.

R36AM1L7ZQ8OK5,B0C1QWWZR4,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound, great battery life, a great buy!",TheRevenite,5.0,"I bought these on the Black Friday sale and man, I'm so glad I did. I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment. I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out. Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings! This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out. Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear. Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes. You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good. The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time. I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music. These are that clear. They also don't kill my ears! I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically. With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app. Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13. Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution. I'd definitely buy these again!","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AHRX7NNP5PFTRE7ODNC2FV7G3Q3Q,1,95,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,"November 29, 2023",2023-11-29,2023-11,JBL,JBL Tune Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I have been looking for a replacement.I bought and returned many over the last couple years; none lived up to my standard. Most of them had poor sound quality. I did buy one pair last year that was decent, but it had connection problems. So I returned it.I pretty much gave up until I came across this one. The price was too good to pass up. It was delivered not quickly, but within the promised time frame. Given my experience, I have low expectations. But the JBL brand name does give me some hope of acceptable quality.BT Connection was fast and secure with no problems so far. Sound quality is much better than I expected, especially for the price. While the sound stage is not as open as my high-end wired headphones, imagining is excellent, which I did not expect. Tonal balance is also excellent with no treble fatigue or excessive bass; I set the equalizer to neutral flat. I can wear it for prolong periods.

Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend?

Mid and treble are the way it sounds perfect for the music, movie and podcast.But the issue is, it's not fit in ear perfectly, it tends to fall down from ear after some time specifically if your ear sweats.I also noticed while talking over the phone for a ling time, for the jaw movement it tends to come out from the ears. I twice face the issue and they dropped from about 5'6"" height and survived.Now, the Ambient sound mode is just a trash. Very little or no sounds are hearable from even 5ft distance. Talk through can help in that case, but talk through make the volume lower by default and can't increase at a certain level.ANC works fine at this price range, but a hissing sound is there and sometimes feels annoying while in between songs.

On par with the good sounding off brand $30 sets. Big difference is that they have features that help with ambient sounds and has noise canceling. Thing though is I was very unimpressed with those features after owning a pair of Bose earphones. These were also really lightweight/cheap feeling compared to my Bose, and weren't as easy to use with the taps and stuff. Then there is the fitment issues. Do they have different size rubber pieces? Yes. 3 sizes, 1 set of each. None of them worked, to the point that almost every facial muscle movement or jaw movement caused them to fall out. Personally I like to be able to talk when I'm on a phone call, but these made it hard to. And trying to watch a movie while eating? Impossible! I spent more time catching/picking up my earbud and trying to resume the movie than I did eating.Ultimately my advice is that if you're not wanting to spend a lot of money on features like noise cancelation, take a chance with an off brand for a third of the price and you'll most likely still have the same sound quality. If you want thise features and are willing to pay this price, spend a little more and get Bose or a good brand that knows how to to it right. If you want them to stay in your ears, go with literally ANYTHING else!Battery life was great though!","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AGWW26SKIF24XO4XCCNYNKU3VQDQ,1,2,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds,"May 30, 2024",2024-05-30,2024-05,JBL,JBL Tune Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I could not even hear the mower and had to take them out once or twice to make sure that the mower was running.

R3FSH2ISQZ07D8,B0CF7GYNW2,5.0 out of 5 stars The Perfect Storm!!! Flawless execution of what SHOULD BE,TheChrisSimon,5.0,"2 years ago I was I acquired a pair of the Galaxy Buds+. I would have never I have purchased them myself, as spending top dollar for a pair of earbuds or headphones to me was not something that I would have spit my money on. I had no instructions, just a little black case in the bottom of a drawer, that someone had left behind. What I discovered, was a piece of technology, that made my life better, and it's quality, simplicity, and joy that it bestowed upon my soul.I only had that unit for a period of maybe 2 months. During that time I use them to live. The full sound l, flawless amplification of surrounding noises, everything about these was amazing. The fit in my ear, the simplicity of touch controls, everything made them something I didn't know that I couldn't live without. Through sheer negligence, I I dropped the right bud into a toilet, and flust it before I realized what had happened. There was a period of grief. And that left bud sat in its case and a drawer for 4 months, as I did not have the disposable funds to go buy a new pair, until it occurred to me to just buy a replacement for the lost bud. Purchase of the second hand market I could never get it to pair and it just sent me further into sadness.Set that time I have made an emission, define a worthy replacement. I have spent conservatively $1,800 and tried every brand from generic to Apple to the Samsung's themselves come and nothing matched the pure perfection of the plus. Well what are you going to do they don't make them anymore. And then on prime I saw that Samsung was selling them, for more then they're top of the line current model. How's this possible? They quit selling them years ago?My theory is that the human ear, Is only so big. There was a team at Samsung that put this bud into the Universe, and those in the upper echelon know it is the Alpha qnd Omaga. I planned up the lessons, and the perfect bargain earbud does not make for the quarterly Prophets jump where the marketing team happy. So they have hidden this, for those that are only in the know. Hey now you know, I bought and Amazon refurbished pair, as well as the buds FE. As a birthday present. The buds FE arrived 3 days before the plus, and I did not unseal the package, because I knew in my heart. I went to my Amazon locker 3 days later with speed and haste that not felts in years. Went home and let them sit for a good I don't know hour and a half as I twittered about my apartment. And when I put them in my ear? Yeah, that's the stuff. Look no further. I mean wait I don't want you to take them all, keep your secret between us.

R2NGKUBNRM0FD6,B0CF7GYNW2,4.0 out of 5 stars Good buds!,David D,4.0,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds in the Graphite color and I have been extremely impressed with their performance. As someone who is always on the go and constantly listening to music or podcasts, having a reliable and comfortable pair of earbuds is essential for me. The Galaxy Buds FE have exceeded my expectations in both of these areas.First and foremost, the comfort and secure fit of these earbuds is top-notch. The wing-tip design ensures that they stay in place even during intense workouts or when I'm running errands. I have tried many other wireless earbuds in the past and have always struggled with finding a pair that stays in my ears comfortably. The Galaxy Buds FE have solved this problem for me and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.The sound quality of these earbuds is also impressive. The audio is clear and crisp, with a good balance of bass and treble. I have used them for both music and phone calls and have been pleased with the sound in both scenarios. The touch controls on the earbuds are also very convenient and easy to use. I can easily pause or skip a song without having to take out my phone.One of the standout features of these earbuds is the auto switch audio. This allows me to seamlessly switch between my phone and laptop when I receive a call or want to listen to something on my computer. It's a small feature, but it has made a big difference in my daily routine.I also appreciate the built-in voice assistant feature. I can easily access my virtual assistant with just a touch of the earbud, making it convenient to make calls, send texts, or get directions without having to take out my phone.The battery life on these earbuds is also impressive. I can use them for several hours without needing to recharge, and the charging case provides additional battery life when I'm on the go. The case is also compact and easy to carry around.Overall, I highly recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds. They offer a comfortable and secure fit, great sound quality, and convenient features that make them a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds. Whether you're a music lover, fitness enthusiast, or just someone who wants a hassle-free listening experience, these earbuds are definitely worth considering.The only drawback is that the case is not wireless charging.

As soon as I opened the case, my phone woke up and was like, ""Eeeey, these yours?"" And I was off to the races.3) Feature rich as all getout. Disclaimer. I am not somebody that likes very feature rich things. I like my audio devices to play audio. Nothing more. These changed my mind completely. It works so seamlessly with the phone it feels like an expansion pack or something. Answering calls is easy and has incredible mic quality. Not sure how. Playing, pausing, and playing next and previous songs all uses one touch surface and it's way easier than expected.4) My absolute favorite thing about these. Audio quality. I'm absolutely blown away by how good these sound. I didn't think it was possible to get such huge sound out of earbuds. These lil things are the size of a roided out bean and they absolutely dominate my entire skull. Most people are going to be like ""Yo the bass is fire. Riz and bruh and other sounds,"" but it's so much more than that. They deliver rich and clean audio across all frequencies. Yes, bass included. Very very f****** included.

Dynamic setting's bass is too heavy. Also, you can set the touch controls to raise or lower volume from the app.The Galaxy Buds FE are a great pair of earbuds for the price.

After I wear them a while my ear gets sore. But if you have normal sized ears you will like them. I miss being able to skip or play back my songs with a touch of the earbuds. My old Samsung buds (from 2020) would do that and were about the same price as these. Good battery life. Not as great as the older version. About the same for phone calls.

I looked at a lot of different options and even tried a set of Anker buds that I ended up returning. I came back to these, which I think are the newer version of what I had. Things I like:-The buttons are very easy to tap and double or triple tap. There are a lot of different options to customize what that does in the app.-Sound quality is great.-The fit is fantastic for me. I love the ear ""wings"". They make a nice secure fit that and it never feels like they are in danger of falling out.-Changing case is compact and these charge easily by dropping them in.-There is an option to set either the right or left earbud to toggle between noise canceling and ambient sound modes when you long press. Both these modes work great. Noise canceling is enough that I can mow the lawn without needing separate ear protection and I can quickly switch to ambient mode if I need to hear someone talking to me.-The biggest upside is that these are quite a bargain.

If you have questions about these topics please read!I purchased these for my boyfriend. He has a Samsung S22. I have bought him multiple types of brand new earbuds in the $70-$80 range in the past. He had to charge all those daily in order to used for 1.5 hrs while he walked. I wanted to buy him something nicer so I bought these. I chose to buy a used set in hopes that they were in great condition and maybe the box was just torn. I changed them overnight on accident (I prefer not to charge too long). Then paired then with my iPhone. I have owned several versions and pairs of iPods and Beats Pro (over the ear). So my first reaction was disappointment because the sound quality did not compare and little things didn‚Äôt work the same. For example when you take your Beats out if your ear whatever your watching stops. That is not the case with these. Also when a call comes in, I had to manually change the option to the ear bud on my phone screen vs just answering by touching my ear. However, I still gave them to my boyfriend for Easter and when he paired them with his galaxy he was prompted to add an extra app that gave him different features than I had with my Apple. Initially he was not too impressed with the sound, he expected them to be louder. The noise canceling was so good, he had to take them out to hear me talk to him. What he loved about them was the length of time he was able to go before charging the case. Remember I charged them one time, then he used them off of my original charge after sitting in the box for a few days. He wore them everyday for 5 days without charging the case. At that point he was really happy with them. Enough to overlook the sound quality since it was not what he expected. Unfortunately when he charged the case he was not able to get the Right earbud to charge. We tried different troubleshooting methods. Unfortunately none of them have worked. We will be sending them back. I don‚Äôt have experience using Apple headphones or buds with Samsung phones but I feel if I had bought these brand new, he would keep them vs buying headphones like mine. I‚Äôd rather pay an extra $50 to get new products going forward. Please air on the side of caution if you buy used or refurbished version of these ear buds. Hopefully this helps someone trying to decide between new or used and Apple/Beats products vs Other earbuds to pair with an android phone.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGJMX2SCRHKROIKHLJLZZB64452A,1,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only,"April 11, 2024",2024-04-11,2024-04,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds FE - True Wireless Earbuds

These are the most confortable buds I've ever used, specially for me since I have tiny ears. I also love the fact that they stay in place when using them for workouts and jogging sessions. The noise cancellation works wonders. I'm not particularly fan of the ambient noise feature, it amplifies the ambient noise to much, even when setting that to ""low"". If I take these to the office, I end up accidentally eavesdropping what my coworkers are talking about from a mile away, which ends up been distracting.

I am so happy I have found something that fits my ears that isn't a $500 + pair of custom molded earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFAU2IZOQTOHAMRQTQ3U745J7MNQ,1,0,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds FE Only,"June 18, 2024",2024-06-18,2024-06,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds FE - True Wireless Earbuds

R2J5F63E48VZCU,B0CF7GYNW2,3.0 out of 5 stars Not overly impressed,Amazon Cutstomer,3.0,"I've only had these a day but there are not many reviews so I'll give my 1st impressions. I wore them for a few hours doing yard work (using my Samsung S22) and tried them with some of my favorite test tracks connected to my PC and using Amazon HD music (using Exclusive mode)The first thing that surprised me was the white case... I ordered black, and at first thought they sent the wrong ones but opened the case and the buds themselves were black. I don't like white, but whatever.Looking at the case there is not much indication of what is the front and it's a bit fiddly to open. The magnet to suck the buds into place is not very strong, so a bit fiddly to lay them in the case.I don't like wearing buds much, but these were pretty comfortable right out of the box. The insertion was not quite as deep as I like but they stayed in well while I was moving around and I did not feel the need to keep adjusting them.How do they sound:I want to emphasize these are first impressions.These have a polite sound that would probably please many people. I'm not one of them. When I got the Lypertek buds for the same price I told people ""I can't believe how good a sound you can get for $100 these days"". With these, I would say ""They are ok, most people would like them"".They are ""fine"" for having something playing in your ear while you do something else but they did not bring out any joy in the music for me. Nothing stood out about the sound. Ordinary comes to mind or, nothing wrong but nothing right. I'm not into 'soundstage' the the lack of one while listening to live tracks actually stood out to me.The sound is a bit congested, the instruments kind of bunched into each other. There is no 'air' around the instruments. I found myself pushing the volume louder than I normally listen to ""wake them up a bit"".Detail retrieval is decent, but you are not going to notice the reverb, the grind of a distorted guitar, the 'ting' of the drumsticks on a cymbal, breath sounds, etc. The overall presentation is smooth enough from low to high, with no glaring holes, or peaks. If I had to fault the frequency response it would be male voices. Just a bit in your face at times. Bass get a bit tubby if you try to push it much. In ""normal"" mode I found it just about right.Let's see what I can 'fix' with EQ. The EQ in the App has 9 bands, cool! But that hardly matters if there is no custom EQ option. Seriously Samsung? The Sennheiser App only has 3 bands but at least they let you set a custom EQ, name it, and save it.There are 7 presets, but none of them really gave me something I liked. But there is enough variety that most people would find something they like.I'm mixed on keeping them. The sound is good enough for what I want them for. listening to music while I do something else. They are comfortable and stay in well, but I am not impressed with the sound. It's ""fine"", it's ""okay"", and ""good enough"" but not impressed with the sound for the $100 price point.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHEC6HVESDBP2W2DMMSYGA4GPGFA,1,40,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only,"October 21, 2023",2023-10-21,2023-10,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds FE - True Wireless Earbuds

Sound quality isn't anything to write home about, but it's good enough. Has an ambient noise feature that I like. The case is magnetic so it's easy to put the buds back in; however, I've dropped the case twice (three foot fall onto carpeted floor) and both times both earbuds fell out which is concerning. Battery life is decent and I have yet to have them die on me. My longest session with them in was about 4 hours. Additional features like tapping to pause media can be a bit finicky and there's been an instance where the buds didn't recognize I was wearing them, so I had to put them back in the case and put them in again to make the right bud turn on.Minus one star because if I wear these for more than 2-3 hours (like when listening to audiobooks) my ears start to hurt.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AEPLLLHZ7SUUJNUBJUU7QATOL77A,1,9,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds FE Only,"March 12, 2024",2024-03-12,2024-03,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds FE - True Wireless Earbuds

R1D1C4VFKDYETP,B09CFP6J6D,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good Clarity and Dynamics, lack fullness",J,4.0,"I usually buy earbuds with a more balanced sound profile (Bose QuietComfort, Samsung Buds+, Jabra Elite 7 Pro). The same goes with Sony C500:1) The base is precise and it is not bloomy or overwhelming2) The treble is a little bright, but not harsh (Jabra Elite 7 Pro has a treble that hurts my ears). I use the equalizer to dial down the treble and dial up the mid just a bit to make it sounds slightly warmer.3) The mid is very detail. I can hear the singers express their emotions very clearly. Much more detail than Bose to my ears (but Bose sounds fuller and richer).4) The sound is dynamic. I feel it can bring out the excitement in music without being overwhelming (more than Bose but Bose has better instrument separation and ""layering"")Other Pros:1) It is super comfortable. I can listen to it many hours without taking it off.2) The equalizer is much better than Jabra. It shows the frequency as well as the decibel.A few things to watch out for:1) Even though the sound is very detail but it also sounds thin, especially for male vocals with deeper voice. Using the equalizer to dial up the mids helps a little bit.2) It sound pretty bad on voice calling.3) Noise Cancellation is not good. I can hear people chatting in the office. I guess it is a give-and-take. This earbud does not require a deep in-ear fit (to be comfortable), so it could be harder to get good noise cancellation. On the other hand, Jabra has good passive noise cancellation, but it is not nearly as comfortable (it has a deeper in-ear fit).I primarily look for a inexpensive earbuds to use in office with good sound and comfort. Given that I buy it on sale, I am happy with this investment. It has almost everything that I am looking for. Wish that it would sound a bit fuller (then it would be perfect).","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2022",AFAIFOEWIMRCGGXVKPDYH6H66ICQ,1,52,Color: Black,"November 16, 2022",2022-11-16,2022-11,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

They stay in place very well during intensive workoutsSound quality: For the money, I've pretty impressed with the sound quality. I own an amp and DAC, planar magnetic headphones, and a pair of wired balanced armature earbuds. So I love good headphones. These give my balanced armature earbuds a good run for their money. These don't have huge bass, but the bass is punchy and well controlled. Highs and mids are good, and there's decent separation and a nice airiness about these. Overall, these have a very well controlled sound profile and work well with most any music genre. These also isolate pretty well, so good that I see no need for wireless buds with noise cancellation, which I personally think is a gimmick that only causes increased drain on the batteries.Battery life: pretty decent, these don't have noise cancelling tech, so battery life is much better than buds that have that tech. One important note, I've found the right earbud will drain faster than the left if I use it frequently to advance or replay tracks.Sony headphone app: I'd recommend downloading the Sony headphone app as this allows you some equalizer features and let's you turn off the buds using the app. Also, the app has some other bells and whistles like an ear analyzer that takes a picture of your ear and optimizes sound to fit your ears. However, you'll need to download one of several 3rd party apps to take advantage of this feature.Overall, these are a fantastic deal for the money, with typical Sony quality and functionality. They work great with my Iphone and integrate with Siri, so you'll have that functionality as well.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AFXBGMTYGUQHDCUX3ZTPDNJDVCTA,1,10,Color: Black,"December 30, 2021",2021-12-30,2021-12,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

I wanted to write an honest review after using them for a while.I'm very happy with them. I tried a different brand but returned them after a couple days. These are heads and shoulder above those.I was concerned that they would fall out, but they fit snuggly, and they stay put without being uncomfortable. I use them when I workout, lifting, riding the bike or running, they have never fallen out. When I remove them, I have to gently tug on them for them to come out. Just make sure you are using the right size rubber attachments.I'm impressed with the sound quality. The app works well and you can actually hear the changes when you change modes.As far as noise cancellation--its more of the rubber inserts than the electronics IMHO. If I'm not listening to music or on a call they act like ear plugs. If you've ever talked wearing ear plugs, you know what I mean. However, when I'm walking the dogs or out in the wind, I can still hear the music with very little wind noise. It's almost as if I have over the ear headphones on.I'm still trying to determine the battery life. I wear them for a couple hours while exercising and a few hours after--I can wear them about 2 days like this until I need to recharge. I don't like to recharge until they are below 20%. The charging case will charge them up to about 75% in about an hour or less.I gave them a 4 because they are small and will sometimes slip out of my fingers when I remove them from my ears.I have the Bose noise cancelling over ear headphones and these are (almost) comparable to those for sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2022",AFXGIV2Y74ZI5ZM2XJJROSNCIHDA,1,1,Color: Black,"March 26, 2022",2022-03-26,2022-03,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

So decided to again pay a bit more for a better quality brand. Motorola was a nice pair and no real complaints other than the select switch on the bud was very touchy but not a deal breaker...just be more careful.Out of the box on normal basic Sony settings I was twice as impressed by the sound quality as the MOTO. Down loaded the Sony app and it made a nice improvement but not overwhelmingly so. Having said that, this is my best favorite pair in the 10 pair in 4 yrs I have been using wireless earbuds. Battery bud is bigger than I like but not a deal breaker...stays in place, sound is the best I have yet heard in a pair of buds(a bit to much bass for me...I like more treble than most younger people so the app helped me there).For the price you can't be to unhappy with this pair.

R1ZPOE559OPBBT,B09CFP6J6D,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good,ariel villalona,4.0,"these in ears have several points to highlight.

1. Noise cancellation is passive, even with the headphones turned off, the outside noise is greatly reduced. Already with music on, it cancels out like 85% of the noise I feel this percentage lower depending on how loud the outside noise is.

2. The comfort is super super good, since I received them I use it 10 hours in a row every day, and it's as if I didn't have anything on. They don't fall off if I move my head, it doesn't bother, they fit well.

3. connectivity, the distance is very good. I can leave my cell phone in one place and walk around the house without losing sound quality.

4. I don't know if the battery is due to my use, but it lasts longer than the brand says. I charge them once every 3, 4 days.

5. the functions (buttons) are easy to use, and even though they are physical buttons, it doesn't bother to press them. And here's why I don't give them 5 stars:

when I use a single earphone, I lose all the functions of the headset that I'm not using. In my opinion, they should have kept the options of the right earphone, which are to change and pause the songs, because if I use only the left one I have to use the mobile phone if I want to pause or change a song.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AF4LRKZWKMEVP4IL72OZQ6ZVAAKA,1,11,Color: Black,"January 16, 2023",2023-01-16,2023-01,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

And overall they are decent earbuds but if you're a music holic like me than you may not be too satisfied. I always been a big fan of Sony products and have had their earbuds in the past so I thought these were going to be great for me. Pros: Battery life is amazing! I used them for about a week before the battery was even close to dying. And I don't use them just a few times a day, I listen to music bascally all day long after work and at gym. So I am extremely impressed with the battery life. Also, they feel very comfortable in your ear, you can barely feel they are in there. Another pro is that they are easy to store in their case and the case is small enough to put in your pocket to carry around. Cons: Doesn't have the best noise cancellation and volume is kind of low. I am able to hear a lot of noise even when volume is all the way up. My main thing about earbuds is not hearing the outside world. I like to be focused on me and the music Im listening to.

R6TZMP2I37T7B,B09CFP6J6D,3.0 out of 5 stars Honestly a little disappointed,Allison Johnson,3.0,So I know Sony produces some killer products however I‚Äôm disappointed on the quality. I use ear buds mainly for music. The sound on them sound quieter than my AirPods or the beats I have. Also I had to download like three different apps for these head phones. You can change the mode of them on the app. There‚Äôs a lot of different modes however I feel like different ones suit different songs. The noise canceling is pretty good. I like that the ear buds fit snug and mute out other noise. I‚Äôm not sure if I like these. I‚Äôm going to try them longer to see if I do like them.

R3GCQKFGE5YLW9,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars I am shocked at how good these sound!,Nicolas Dozmati,5.0,"I typically don't write reviews, even if I like the product a lot. This set of earbuds absolutely surpassed my expectations for bluetooth audio quality; I even have a set of wired ones also by Sony that don't sound as good as these ones.I own a Galaxy/Android device, although the packaging claims that they only pair to Apple products, I had zero issues pairing my earbuds and their app is very user friendly. It's also a bonus that the case takes a USB Type C, same charging cord as my Galaxy phone and several phones out there (comes with cord too).The loudest of loud volumes can't even be heard from outside of the earbuds when correctly fitted to the ear, so you don't have to worry about being that guy with the loud heavy metal on your transit.My only complaint is that while you can seamlessly wear either earbud interchangeably, you cannot remap what functions the bud performs; right one does the pause-play functions while the left controls volume. I would just prefer pause-play on both, but maybe the volume function will grow on me. Also, the touch features for the earbuds are a press-down activation, not a finger sense, which I both prefer and kinda don't, depends on the earbud; this one does it right.To restate it, I am absolutely in shock at how good these wireless Sony earbuds are. While I am no review guru, I hope you take my word and praise for these bluetooth earbuds by Sony! :D","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2022",AG6GMWWJADURM4YKB37CEQEBKQZQ,1,5,Color: Black,"June 22, 2022",2022-06-22,2022-06,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

My first pair of another brand had to be returned because they rain out of battery time during the night, but they had the noise cancelling option.The Sony's do not have a the noise cancelling option, which is why, I guess, the play time is much longer than the other.They come with an app you can download which allows you to turn off ALMOST ALL of the voice commands that the other set would set off during the middle of the night. The caveat in the app setting is that it will still send what it considers to be ""important"" voice commands (I notice ""power on"" when first putting on).I would say the biggest negative is that, if wearing for sleep, the bud buttons can be set off easier than the other set I tried, but I tap the right one and it was back to the rain sound (Amazon prime music)Overall, a good earbud for sleeping, but have not used for daytime listening or phone usage.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2022",AE6TKNGDLNLFRMRPEJG7JNUT2MEA,1,1,Color: Black,"April 3, 2022",2022-04-03,2022-04,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

R276VWWAGXV6VT,B09CFP6J6D,1.0 out of 5 stars Readme 1st: Not for Windows users... Mediocre sound quality even by Sony standards.,Persepolis,1.0,"This is on the cheaper end of Sony's offerings, given the price tag I would at a minimum expect good quality... wrong. It falls short of a 10 year old wired Sony MDREX58V, at 3x the price...Here are the pro's and con's:Pro: Quick bluetooth connect/disconnects.Con: Audio quality is just BAD... tinny and weak out of the box. It falls short of an older Sony MDREX58V I have which is only $20, it falls short of most $20-$30 no-name ear buds, and falls, and falls pretty close to a set of freebie earbuds I got while flying United a few years back. This is not good! I think Sony tried to differentiate between their high end offerings so badly that they killed the quality on this one so they can fill the lower price tier.Pro: Comfortable fit, lighter than some of the other ear buds I've used.Con: Software to control behavior is only available on Android and iOS... so if you're using it on a Windows PC, while it will pair and it will ""function"", it sounds like crap... and it will stay that way. In 2019, there were about 850mil iPhones in use... and about 900mil Windows PC's in use... not sure the what ledge the MBA's hit their heads on before deciding Windows users don't get the app thats needed to properly use these earbuds. For yuks sake, I do have both an iOS device and an Android... and installed the app on both of those... and the sound quality didn't get much better by adjusting the equalization envelope. Increasing the base just seemed to eat away at the midrange... It was weird to say the least.Pro: It can be reasonably loud. So you're getting mediocre sound, just loud mediocre sound... LOL.Anyways... summary: This is a low price offering from Sony that has been neutered so they can offer you something for $60... the only problem is that it performs worse than the $20 offering from others.Lack of a Windows app was not a particularly good decision given how low performing these are... a little bit of signal processing could have helped save these a bit...Summary: Save your money... Go with something cheaper or better... these miss the mark.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2023",AG3AJG3Y25SPLXT636HIL2BHQYKQ,1,2,Color: Black,"March 28, 2023",2023-03-28,2023-03,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

Moving these earbuds between devices personally feels like a chore because I keep forgetting what weird button combo puts it into pairing mode and they are so slow to pair.

How you position them in your ear, which size silicone bud you use, and playing with EQ settings make a dramatic difference in sound quality. After trying the different sizes and downloading the sony headphones app and playing around, they sound and feel really good. Sony makes a quality product.

Connectivity is easy, and they're durable with an insanely great battery life. The only real negative is the main button (only in the right side) is large... perhaps too large.As I wear them longer, like all headphones they shift within my ears, so they require adjusting. This is where I often hit that large button while adjusting them into my ear. The previous version of these had a small button on the rim that was much more difficult to mistakenly hit.So just be aware, they function great... but be prepared for an accidental song pause (1 tap) or skip (2 taps) every now and then.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2022",AGON5T3NV4QR3Q5SATPFFFHLBBPQ,1,1,Color: Black,"March 28, 2022",2022-03-28,2022-03,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

It was such an extended ordeal, I've no idear what was the final solve or how it finally worked. They weren't showing up on as an option to connect to even thought they were literally next to both my iPhone or my laptop and fully charged.

The sound quality is pretty great, the battery life is exceptional, the range is good enough that I can take the garbage out without taking these out... There's very little to dislike.

The first is that, while the headphones recharge incredibly quickly in the carrying case (it takes about an hour for them to go from 0-100%, in my experience), the case itself charges pretty slowly. I would recommend charging it overnight. The second is that there are still some small technical problems. The headphones occasionally don't charge for whatever reason (this is typically fixed by just slightly moving them in their charging compartments), and I occasionally do need to restart my laptop to get them to reconnect. Neither of those are dealbreakers, and I would highly recommend these headphones, especially if they're going to stay at $70 for the foreseeable future.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2022",AFXXAW2WYTQ2O5REIUI5VSBC2KTQ,1,1,Color: Black,"May 6, 2022",2022-05-06,2022-05,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

Also, personally have had a difficult time finding earbuds that fit well, and these do a decent job of not slipping out of my ears. I actually prefer that function buttons are mechanical switches rather than touch-sensitive. I bought a pair of Sony open-back Linkbuds that were over twice as expensive as these Sony Earbuds, and while the sound quality is much better I prefer to use these more often. The more expensive Linkbud's fit is constantly slipping.

Sound quality is absolutely awful - OK-ish for podcasts where audio quality isn't a big factor, but for music? Forget about it. Super tinny and lacking in any depth or vibrance.Then there's the ergonomics. These are absolutely useless for working out. They fall out - constantly.

They also have buttons on the side for touch controls (pause/play, volume control, call pickup/end) and Sony allows for some sound customization in the app. Best part about them is that they are independent and each earbud (Left or Right) can be used alone unlike some other budget wireless earbuds.

R1G28XEXNA4QFG,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony Quality Shines Through with these Earbuds!,Shawshank,5.0,"I ordered these earbuds because I wanted a quality set of earbuds that weren't a cheap throwaway pair after a year but didn't want to drop the coin on a set of Apple or Bose earbuds. Sony has a good rep in the consumer electronics space and after doing a little research outside of Shamazon, I decided I would give the WF-C500's a shot. A few things I like about these specific buds.1. Fitment - they fit in my ears well and they stay in my ears without causing hot spots or pain points.2. Battery life - I can't give you a precise number, but I can use these earbuds throughout the day and even into the night and still have some battery life in the morning.3. Sound - These specific earbuds I use primarily for listening to Audible audiobooks, so I don't need an eardrum ticking base or eye-watering treble highs, that said I did test these out with a few of my favorite artists - Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, AC/DC, old Van Halen, Vivaldi, the usual stuff we all listen to and in each style of music, I was very pleased, it was accurately represented within the context of having a half thimble-sized device stuck in my ear. Win. I also use these for phone calls, when someone calls and interrupts my audiobook, and I've always gotten good feedback from the other person on the call, in terms of clarity, volume of voice, and even outdoors, the wind management seemed to not negatively impact my call.4. Earbud controls - There is a pro/con to the way you control these earbuds. I'll flat-out tell you I am not a fan of the touch-sensitive earbuds. I have big hand and rarely do I touch it in the way it wants to be touched and I end up hanging up on someone while I'm trying to turn up the volume or whatever the case is. The WF-C500's are more of a button-press kind of thing. It's tactile - you know exactly what your finger is doing when it's doing it because of that tactile feedback. I freaking love that. Super-duper simple!! So what's the con Shawshank? Glad you asked. It's probably a horrible habit but I use one of the earbuds when I go to sleep. Usually an audiobook, might be some Ludovico Einaudi, or that soothing ocean or thunderstorm sound with some good ol' scripture in the background. The problem is I'm a side-sleeper and SOMETIMES when I roll over to the side that has the earbud in it, the pillow will act like my finger and hit that little tactile button and pause whatever I'm listening to. I can hit it again and be a little more careful when I put my head back on the pillow, but that does happen. It's probably a bad habit anyway, but that's the con of the controls on these earbuds, from my POV anyway.5. Overall quality - I really can't complain about these earbuds. I've dropped them in the sink while washing my face, and forgotten to take them out when taking a shower (I realized after the water hit my head that I was still listening to whatever it was I was listening to, but they got a good dose of water sprayed on them, and there were times where one did fall out of my ear, primarily because I didn't seat it well.I have been so pleased with these earbuds, that I bought my 17 yr old son a pair and he is also very happy with them. He listens to music primarily, 70-80-90's music (yeah he has good taste in music for a teenager.) :-)An update after I had written this. I ran into a problem with the left earbud not connecting to BT. I contacted Sony support because they have a 1 yr limited warranty, and I bought these back in May of last year. We tried doing a full reset, which didn't correct the problem. The CSR provided me the info to send them back, I received an email with a FedEx shipping label, dropped them off at the Fedex in a Dollar General nearby, 2 days later they arrived at the Sony repair facility, 1 day after that, Sony notified they had ordered a brand new pair of WF-C500's for me and I should get them next week.I'm not usually the kind of guy that gets massively butt-hurt when something breaks. Stuff happens. What I don't enjoy is when I am trying to correct a problem, be it a defect or whatever, with the manufacturer or the store and it becomes a battle of will and plain old integrity of service. My experience with Sony was outstanding. They asked me to try and correct the issue by doing a hard reset and when that didn't work, they moved right into replacement mode. I dig and respect that. So I wholeheartedly recommend this product. Unlike the growing number of Shamazonians who get free stuff to test and write reviews even though in all honestly sometimes they don't know crap about the product, I am a guy who buys his own stuff and in this case, I was 110% daily user of these Sony WF-C500 earbuds - at home, in my truck, at the gym, in the kitchen, in the bathroom (oops), outside mowing my grass and running my airplane sounding weedeater, in all cases this audio was good, and most importantly, I didn't lose one out of my ear and run my mower over it. As far as ""noise cancellation"", I will just refer to the numerous times my bride yelled at me because I didn't hear her when she was talking to me. I suppose in some regards that counts as ""noise cancellation"". (my beautiful Brazilian bride, if you happen to read this, you know your man loves ya.)BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): They feel good in the ear. They sound good in the ear. You don't look like you have a Chernobyl growth sticking out of your ears like some of the other earbuds. Perhaps best of all - Sony sticks behind their products and they understand what excellent customer service should be. These are the factors that drive my review and are the reason I bought a pair for my son, to whom I don't give him a rock when he asks for bread if you know what I mean. But he never asked for these, I knew the pair he had for 3+ years was having issues and wanted to surprise him. He was surprised on top of being happy. That's probably the highest recommendation I can provide, for what I give to the absolute pride and joy of my life - well I can't see these not being good enough for the King of England if they're good enough for my son.I'll TRY to remember and update my review with some pics when I get the new earbuds. Chances are however, that I will forget and probably remember when I'm in a situation that precludes me from executing the review update in that moment I'm thinking about it. But I'll try. BTW the price dropped on these. I paid $90 bucks for my pair and my sons pair, and I think I saw them for $70ish or $79 and they are worth every buck of that even at $90.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AE46KEUAAPWZ3CWV3BKSR4PTUBSA,1,8,Color: Black,"February 23, 2024",2024-02-23,2024-02,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

First off, I have spent over 20 years in the audio industry and consider myself myself somewhat of an audiophile - so sound quality is very important. Unfortunately, that time in the audio industry listening at high DBs has no doubt cost me some hearing - so strong volume is also very important to me.Thanks to Amazon's return policy I have tried many highly rated ear buds under $100 on the market:Ear Fun Free Pro 2 = Great sound, great NC, good volume but would NOT stay in my ears,Soundcore Anker Life P3 = great sound quality, features, but NOT loud enough.SoundPeats MiniPro AC = Great volume, good sound but stick out way too far and fall out of my ears.Palm Buds Pro = just not loud enough!Soundcore Life A2 NC+ = Great Sound, Great volume, great features but stick out too far and also fall out of my ers!Now on to these Sony WF-C500s = Great sound, very good volume, 10 hour battery life, well designed case, nice app, and fit my ears like a glove. Heck I can even side sleep and not usually press a control accidentally, I have had no problems with people hearing me on phone calls. I can work out and they don't fall out of my ears! While they are not overly bass heavy (more true to the music), it can't be beefed up with the EQ in the app. I made a Custom EQ with pretty much the same settings as the Treble Boost EQ but raised the Clear Bass setting. The result is more than adequate bass, good separation and very good volume. I ordered all the above buds about the same time and when I tried these Sony's I figured they were the keeper. After trying all the others I mentioned, I kept coming back to these WF-C500s!

They're alright.They stay in my ears surprisingly well, the battery lasts much longer than I'll ever need it to. The case is made of a pretty cheap feeling plastic, but the buds themselves feel higher quality.My main issue with these is that the audio quality (by default, at least) is HORRIBLE. Maybe I'm just spoiled by higher quality, wired earbuds but they are far below average by most standards. The saving grace, however, is that the app lets you tamper with the different levels and tune the audio to your liking. I managed to get it to sound a bit better, but I couldn't find a way to make the audio any louder which is unfortunate. The buds are very quiet.Overall they're pretty good. If you're able to spend more, it may be worth it, but they're great value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2022",AGF2BQZ47JL5CP2XJEEHFYHQMJ6A,1,4,Color: Black,"September 14, 2022",2022-09-14,2022-09,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

The comfort level isn't great although it depends on earsand type and size of the tips, ok, they fit snug, they charge easily and last a long time on charge,very convenient for running around town, etc. walks, exercise, shopping, etc. However, with myiPhone or lossless player, I never, ever achieve the type of power and volume and quality levelsthat I get with my full wired headphone amp/player Fiio rig. These get somewhat loud butnot very, they seem to be limited to a certain threshold and it doesn't matter what the sourceis. I never have those issues with my full wired headphone and IEM rig.For serious listeningI would opt for the latter, always, but the Sony C500 are good when I just want to run aroundtown and even drive and cannot use the full rig I have. The comfort level wasn't great,though, which is a reason I often don't love IEMs or earbuds. For the money these soundpretty good, clear, but I cannot get the type of audiophile performance from them I wouldhope for, due to the wireless, so I guess I just don't love wireless so far. Meanwhile I owna brand new 70 watts per channel BT speaker that blows these earbuds out of the waterin every respect. But that's a fully amped full range portable speaker.Until Sony and other mfgrs. come up with a fully built-in self-amplified BT IEM or earbud,these will be for convenience only, really. They are cool but don't make me want to sitwith them in my ears (uncomfortably) for hours on end. For the $45 that I paid for themthough, I guess they're a good value for on the go usage. They were easy to pair and easyto figure out how to use them for controlling them, and the Sony apps. I downloaded to usewith them seem to work just fine, but what's the use of EQ and all that when the deviceitself is limited totally in terms of amp power and volume? And the power coming outof the iPhone is limited?","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2022",AF44WNOTPEI52RKXG3B3ROB3I57Q,1,5,Color: Black,"October 13, 2022",2022-10-13,2022-10,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

I use one at a time, as I need to be aware of other things around me. They are sweat proof, I can vouch for that . Two summers in the AZ desert, and they‚Äôre still going. They sound great for music, videos, streaming tv, and my favorite- audiobooks. I only have two complaints, which really are small enough that when I need to replace them, I will ABSOLUTELY be getting more Sonys!1. I wish you could use the start/stop button feature on either earbud. I tend to use one at a time, so when the battery dies, and I switch, I can‚Äôt use the start/stop feature on the left earbud.2. Sometimes when charging, they don‚Äôt get good contact, so they don‚Äôt charge. I always check to make sure the light is on, but sometimes it just stops, and you have to adjust it to start charging again.With those two very small complaints taken into consideration, it‚Äôs a very small inconvenience for an extremely high quality product that I use on average, probably 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.If I could give these earbuds a better rating, I would.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AHQKL7WVKDS2DSZXMC23IHZ7U4ZA,1,2,Color: Black,"April 4, 2024",2024-04-04,2024-04,Sony,Sony WF-C500 - True Wireless Earbuds

Overall they sound pretty good for under $50. The 2 issues I encountered are:1) They don't get loud enough. I used them while I was mowing my lawn and the noise cancelling gets rid of some of the background noise, but not enough to immerse a person in their music if there's something loud in the background.2) They don't go deep enough into the ear canal. In ear monitors need to couple with your ear canal in order to stay in place and reproduce low frequencies well. This made them very light in the bass and if I tried to boost the bass with my phone's EQ, it would start to distort at ""high"" volumes.If they went about a 1/4"" deeper it might take care of both problems. I'll probably look for different ear pieces to attach to these that will go deeper into the ear canal.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",AGRARCPQFSTBNWQ5KGBZCYQ3YNMA,1,11,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"October 23, 2023",2023-10-23,2023-10,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds

R1UP1UTTWDI6CH,B0BZTCXG6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice,Bridgette,5.0,"Being a huge fan of the Panasonic ergofit wired buds, these were a prime choice for my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds ever. Suffice to say I love Bluetooth earbuds now and will never go back to wired. These buds are great. The charge lasts forever. With a good custom EQ, and Dolby Atmos ON, they provide very nice bass and clear voices. The sound quality is on par with the wired version, all things being equal, as these do have the extra bass from their larger drivers.The buds are black, clean, and no fuss with a neat little angle in them for the ""ergo-fit"" gimmick. I don't think they fit any better than other earbuds, but they do look nice. The buds are also quite large with their 10mm drivers, almost seeming oversized. This gives them a more expensive look.Unlike my husband's other brand of wireless buds, these buds have NO LEDs on the buds themselves, which I quite enjoy. No annoying red/blue lights blinking constantly, and also saves battery, I imagine.Pairing was very simple and quick on my S20 Ultra, without reading any instructions whatsoever, and just opening the case, they immediately showed in the Bluetooth connection and paired quickly. They seem to pair far faster and more reliably than my husband's wireless buds. Simply turn bluetooth on, and tap ""RZ-B310W"". My husband's initial set up for his buds was an annoying dance of pairing each bud separately, and opening and closing the case. These buds both pair at same time, every time for me, and can connect even when they're inside the case charging.The case is nice, minimalistic and has a nice magnetic snap close. No LED screen like my husband's earbuds, but I find that an unnecessary expense. There's a little red LED light to show when it's charging. The tiny case holds many hours of charge, and I'm surprised daily that the buds just keep going, even though I'm wearing them a good portion of the day.The buds snap magnetically into their ports, and I will admit it can be a pain when you go to put them back in figuring out which one goes in which port, as they only go in one way.The buds fit in my ears is ""OK"", not perfect. I have small ear canals. They do stay in, but I can tell when the seal gets broken if I smile or laugh and they move out of place the tiniest bit.That's a small annoyance rather niche for people with tiny ear canals like myself though.I never read the instructions so figured out by trial and error how to activate the different modes and things like pause. Currently to change mode, I cup my palm against the bud as if to push it further in my ear for a couple seconds until I hear the voice over saying what's been activated. Still haven't figured out exactly where to touch and hold with one finger to change modes, but my way works for me.To pause/play, I press a fingertip against the round back of the bud. Unfortunately it's probably quicker to just use your phone to pause/play, as you cannot just tap the bud but have to press and hold for a second. On the other hand, that's a positive as it's much harder to accidentally hit it, unlike my husband's buds, where he often hangs up mid-call because he pushed the bud for a split second to get it back in his ear fully.So, about the noise cancellation, it's pretty nice! There's definitely a noticeable difference between the three modes. I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, but wanted to try it out as I've never had noise cancelling buds.There's ""Ambient Sound"", which amplifies your surrounding noise to hear comfortably even while wearing earbuds. Makes hearing others, and safety sounds like traffic, loud and clear. Not ideal to use when just chilling at home, as it makes surrounding noise very loud, but great in public or if walking/jogging/biking on a road or having a conversation with someone else.There's the option ""Off"" which seems to be just the default experience of wearing normal earbuds. Sound is slightly muffled, but still comes through.Finally, the option for ""Noise Cancelling"", which is quite striking when you use it for the first time. In my room with an AC on and white noise in the background, it dramatically lowered the apparent noise coming into my ears to a near imperceptible whisper. If I didn't know better, I would've thought there was NO AC or white noise in my room and it was near-silent.So, the noise cancellation works great for continuous sounds, yes. But other dynamic noises like human voices, it doesn't work as well. If you are buying these for the noise cancelling element, like if you, say, live in a noisy house and want to sleep better at night, I'd choose a more robust set with great active noise cancelling. Or if you just want to drown out ALL noise around you. But I will say, with noise cancelling on, and some brown noise playing on the buds from YouTube, that would provide a good night's sleep in a noisy home for sure, and it's been done many times by myself since getting these buds.... Only issue is finding them in the morning as they inevitably fall out with my tossing and turning!But I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, though it was a gimmick I wanted to try. I bought these for sound quality, and they deliver, when set up correctly. I've never been one to just use the default sound settings on my phone/PC for any pair of buds I've had, but my initial impression from the DEFAULT EQ on my S20 Ultra was that, out of the box, the buds were too bass-forward for me, at the loss of necessary mids and highs. They sounded a bit, muffled. In music, I prefer the voice to be at the forefront and crystal clear in the genres I enjoy. I also listen to a lot of podcasts, so I quickly did a custom EQ to suit my needs, and I recommend everyone does for *any* pair of headphones they have, as it can make a huge difference. I do listen to rap and hip-hop occasionally, but if that is your *predominant* preference, these may be perfect for you out of the box without adjustment. For other genres and general listening, in my opinion, these are too bassy. I want the bass to be there, but not as front as it comes in these earbuds.There's a nifty setting on the newer android phones to make a custom EQ right in the sound settings without a separate app, and even a way to get a personalized EQ by testing your hearing, to adjust for the loss of perception that comes with age. I recommend playing around with that and making your own custom equalizer to suit your needs if you don't like the initial sound quality.It's exceedingly rare I get a pair of headphones that sound to my liking out of the box, as these days heavy bass is so championed.All that being said, I'm very satisfied with my first set of wireless buds, and I think Panasonic knocked it out of the park at this price point, just like they did with the ergo-fit wired buds I've loved for years.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AEYM6LOYQKQ5PPKYPSKIHFOCX3GQ,0,0,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"June 24, 2024",2024-06-24,2024-06,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds

R3NPY1F9JHC976,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Quite impressive,Yan L.,4.0,"The Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling have impressed me with their exceptional sound quality and convenient features. From their sleek design to their powerful audio performance, these earbuds provide a satisfying listening experience that will elevate your music enjoyment.The first thing that caught my attention was the ergonomic design of the earbuds. They fit snugly and comfortably in my ears, thanks to the multiple sizes of ear tips included in the package. The lightweight construction ensures extended periods of use without discomfort, making them suitable for daily activities or intense workout sessions.The sound quality delivered by these earbuds is truly remarkable. The built-in noise cancelling technology effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your favorite tunes. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, with a particular emphasis on the powerful bass response. The XBS (Extra Bass System) feature adds depth and richness to the low-end frequencies, enhancing the overall listening experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.With Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, pairing the earbuds with my device was seamless and hassle-free. The wireless connection remained stable even when moving around, and I experienced minimal latency while watching videos or playing games. The touch controls on the earbuds provide easy access to playback controls, volume adjustment, and even voice assistant activation, making it convenient to manage your audio on the go.The included charging case is compact and sleek, serving as a secure storage solution for the earbuds while also providing additional battery life. The case's built-in battery can recharge the earbuds multiple times, ensuring that you can enjoy your music throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The USB-C charging port offers fast charging capabilities, minimizing the downtime between listening sessions.While the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and convenient features, there are a few areas where they could be further improved. The battery life of the earbuds themselves could be extended, as they offer around 4-5 hours of continuous playback, which may not be sufficient for long trips or extended listening sessions without access to the charging case. Additionally, the touch controls on the earbuds can sometimes be overly sensitive, leading to accidental commands.Overall, the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling offer an impressive audio experience, combining powerful bass, effective noise cancelling, and convenient features in a compact design. Whether you're a music lover, a fitness enthusiast, or someone who appreciates wireless freedom, these earbuds deliver on their promise of immersive sound and provide great value for their price.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",AEG5NYGZDCB5CQWBIIR2YPNZFQQA,0,4,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"June 13, 2023",2023-06-13,2023-06,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds
R1GTMZ7X8PAZVM,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars A good performer,WT,4.0,"The Panasonic RZ-B310W is not currently compatible with the Panasonic Audio Connect app so you are limited to the controls available on the earbuds and there isn't an equalizer. Controls available using the touch panels on the earbuds include music control (pause, forward, backward) and sound control (ANC, ambient sound, off). Unfortunately, sound control toggles from ANC to Off to Ambient Sound. This means it takes two touches to go from ANC to Ambient Sound and I find that to be a bit annoying. I prefer going from ANC to Ambient to Off. You can also turn the buds on or off using the touch panels. The earbuds are lightweight, comfortable and fit my ears well. I can get a good seal using the included eartips and the sound isolation is very good. Construction quality is excellent as you would expect from Panasonic. The charging case is small and will easily slip into a pocket.The earbuds are tuned too bright for my liking. I use the equalizer in my music app to tune the earbuds. The bass is strong without being boomy but sounds a bit loose. The overall sound signature is V-shaped but pleasing to the ear. However, you must get a good seal or the sound is really messed up, with little bass, no midrange and shrill highs. These earbuds are not for critical listening but if you want something for casual listening while commuting or working at your desk, give these a try.Noise isolation and bass response depends on your achieving a good fit with one of the included eartips. If you can't get a good seal, the bass will be nearly non-existant and the treble will overpower everything.Active noise cancellation is better than I expected. It isn't at the level of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 but it does reduce a significant amount of low frequency noise, like the roar of jet engines. To be honest I wasn't expecting this level of noise cancellation in a $99 earbud. It also does a fair job of reducing office noises.I don't normally use earbuds to make to take calls so I haven't checked the voice quality during calls.Overall, I'm very pleased with the RZ-B310W. I can easily recommend them as one of the best I've used under $100.

RYSBT2D2ZXIFR,B0BZTCXG6T,3.0 out of 5 stars Fine for the Price - But I Have Quirks,Romain,3.0,"Overall, I think these earbuds are good for the price point, but it has a few quirks that make using them less enjoyable.Sound Quality is its best feature. I tested them against my son's AirPods Gen 2 and my AirPod Pros Gen 1 on an iPhone via Apple Music. My go to song to test listening devices is Ray Charles ""Georgia on my Mind"" (mid volume). That song has a lot happening, and I can pick-up how well the device is as letting you hear all the details. I thought the Panasonic sounded better than the AirPod, and it held its own against the AirPod Pro. Had I played other songs, I think the Pro would win outright because of Spatial Audio features. For added fun, I listen to the track with a wired Beats earbud (lighting cord), and that beat all 3 of them.Ergonomics is Terrible. As others have mentioned, just to get it out of the case is a challenge, if you have larger fingers. When you take it out of your ears, it still plays. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but worth nothing. The case is nice looking but it does not have a sturdy feel. I case see it cracking with a moderate fall to the ground.Software and Other Quirks makes it hard to love. To start, there was no feedback on the case to tell you when it was fully charged, charging the case or charging the ear buds. Same goes with low battery. I could not make out when I needed to charge it, other than waiting for it to not play or connect. Perhaps the app is suppose to help with that? With a good app, it probably would be manageable.It's a very possessive device. As mentioned, I have multiple buds. If I start using the Panasonics, and decide to switch to another device, the Panasonics kept trying to jump back in, even when the buds were in the case. I don't know if I got a bad one or what, but a few times I had to move it away from my phone to get it to not try to take over.If it will be your only bluetooth listening device, and you don't plan on using the buttons, I think it would be fine. For me, I am already slotting the Panasonics as my TV at night device or another dedicated source to avoid it getting confused.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2023",AEYMAQNZ7LDD6SWFBFCYN7UCFBLA,0,6,Style: Earbuds,"May 17, 2023",2023-05-17,2023-05,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds

I've used these while running and don't slip around or start to fall out.I think the sound is decent -- not great, but not terrible. The bass is well balanced. I also use these for video calls and people report they can hear me well. In video calls, other people's voices sound slightly harsh, which I don't love. But they are definitely servicable sound. If you're really into audio balancing, you probably won't like these, though.The noise cancelling is also somewhat mediocre. I can kinda tell it's doing something, but when people are talking nearby or my dogs bark elsewhere in my house, I can hear it. They don't have the kind of noise cancelling where you put on and remove your headphones and can really notice the difference the noise cancelling makes.The thing I like the least about these are the touch controls. They are really tough to get to work and they don't work beyond play/pause with my Android phone (Pixel 7 pro). When I use these paired to my computer, I have to really focus on how I tap and where exactly my finger lands to get the controls to respond. If I'm wearing these out while running, I have to stop running and hold still to get the play/pause to work. Otherwise, if I'm paired with my phone, I can't get it to advance/repeat track or change volume. I tried downloading the Panasonic devices app, thinking that might be the issue, but I can't get that to work at all (it never pairs with the headphones and is stuck in a loop).In the end, these aren't worth the money to me. I'd rather spend more for a more solid product that works, like Airpods or GalaxyBuds, or go for a cheaper pair that might not have the nice fit, but has more functional touch controls.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2023",AGNYUVQAVT6VARWZ5ZNRSFDH3BNQ,0,6,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"June 4, 2023",2023-06-04,2023-06,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds
R1X5DJA9RJ2OID,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Punchy sound and a comfortable fit,expatbrit,4.0,"These are impressive earbuds that do a lot of things right and only come up short in 2 areas.The sound is bass heavy, as expected from the XBS feature, and it can produce some really meaty lows, but this can be dialed down with a good equalizer.Out of the box they sounded a little underwhelming but they improved steadily after a dozen hours or so. I still prefer the more enveloping sound of my Soundpeats buds, but these are more than acceptable, especially with a high bit rate streaming service.There's plenty of volume on tap and the Bluetooth range is a little more than 30 feet, about par for the course across similar products.Panasonic is always good at proving clear instructions, but only the quick start guide is useful here, with picture based instructions. The little booklet offers safety advice in multiple languages, an odd inclusion.One thing these RZs excel at is comfort. Once you find the right rubber tips (3 sizes included) then they stay put, some of the best I've tried. Even talking and eating couldn't shift them, a rare find in my experience. These would make excellent buds for the gym.Battery life is a key selling point on the box, and it's proving correct so far; with minimal charging and extended use, no 'battery low' warning yet. Charging is via a USB C type port, widely becoming the standard these days.One downside is the fiddly shape of the bud and the case, it's all too smooth with no real area to grip, so getting them out of the case takes practice. The touch controls are also slow to respond but work well enough once you get the right zone at the top of the stalk.There's no noise cancelling to speak of (I have tested them on a plane) but they don't claim to have it, so that's OK.For the user looking for a good all-round set of wireless buds, from a household name that will almost certainly be around to honor a warranty in years to come, these are a solid value.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2023",AFMRUDC57F6M2LQATDMSNGXBHU3A,0,3,Style: Earbuds,"June 1, 2023",2023-06-01,2023-06,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds
R2E8WJH3WQ07TL,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars An affordable option that deliver good results on sound quality and functionality,Kevin,4.0,"Although I am not a power-user when it comes to wireless earbuds, I am picky when it comes to comfort, and most importantly, sound quality. For may years now I have used AirPods and AirPods Pro models. I have generally been very satisfied with them, with the latter being a little less comfortable for me than I would prefer, and sound quality of both being on the above average side. And as far as functionality, they have worked pretty much flawlessly for me.When I saw these Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds, they seemed to boast the features that I tend to look for ‚Äì good sound, Bluetooth connectivity, noise cancelling, a portable charging case ‚Äì and of course, good sound quality with good base.My overall impression of the Panasonic‚Äôs is on the good side of the spectrum. As far as sound quality, in my opinion, I have found them to be on par with my AirPod Pros, and better than my standard AirPods, but that should be expected given that the Panasonics seal in your ears just like the AirPod Pros do. I‚Äôve also found the noise cancelling and ambient sound modes to work very well. I would however give the edge to the Pros on ambient sound mode. The Panasonics have something of a white-noise in the background when using ambient sound mode, and it is noticeable when you are not playing music.On phone calls, I can hear very clearly, and based on my testing, callers can also hear me very clearly, so the microphones do a very good job on phone calls. I would say that they seem to pick up a little more ambient noise than my AirPods, and callers can hear more background noise when speaking to me. But overall, unless you are doing something noisy, they work fine.As far as fitment goes, I‚Äôve found these to be bulkier than my Airpods and AirPod Pros. I would also say they are just slightly less comfortable than the Pros as well. But, given the activities that I use ‚Äúear-sealing‚Äù earbuds for, like jogging, mowing the lawn and working outside, I find them to be more than comfortable enough. Comfort is very subjective, so these may or may not be a good option for you.As to overall build quality, the Panasonic earbuds themselves feel solid and well made. The case on the other hand has something of an empty feeling to it, unlike the Apple cases which feel sturdy and well made. But regardless, the case works just fine, which ultimately is what matters.I have noticed that the Bluetooth connection with the Panasonics is not as resilient as it is with either pair my AirPods. In an open and unobstructed environment, the reliability of the connection, and the range of the connection is perfectly fine. However, if you introduce obstructions and if you change the orientation of your body, you will start losing the connection. If you keep your phone on your person this should not be a problem, but I like to place my phone down somewhere safe while I am mowing or if I am working on projects outdoors, and I have been annoyed by the tendency of the connection to drop more often than the AirPods do.So overall, what do I think about the Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds? Well, I like that you can get good sound quality while listening or speaking - and out of earbuds for under $100 dollars as not everyone has the money to purchase more expensive options. While the Panasonics lack some of the refinement of more expensive units, they put out good sound and offer the convenience of a portable charging case like their more expensive cousins. For working out, working outdoors, or just working around the house while jamming some tunes, I see these as an affordable option that shouldn't disappoint you, particularly as these are a value item in my opinion. I do feel like they could do a little bit better on the price though - $80 seems like an attractive figure, and the lower the cost gets under that $100 price point, the more attractive these Panasonics become.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AENI5LOLYRFOHEFFXIF52VVR7CSQ,0,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"May 19, 2023",2023-05-19,2023-05,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds

The sound was amazing, and I was able to focus on what I was doing and what I was listening to instead of all the chaos around me... but the sound from all the other teachers talking and joking around me was not completely canceled. It was more like hearing them from underwater: I was aware of the sound, the tempo or cadence of people speaking, but couldn't make out what they were saying and a couple of times I had to figure out that someone was talking to me because they were trying to make eye contact. I could hear them speaking, but could not make out the words.They are very comfortable, and they last for a long time, and I think they are a good level of noise limiting, but not quite canceling.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AGLLV5CA5XAOSRIYRED2MGJUPR6Q,0,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"August 16, 2023",2023-08-16,2023-08,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds

RQZ41ITP5MOLF,B0BZTCXG6T,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Rob M.,2.0,"I have owned and tested dozens of true wireless earbuds over the past few years.I really wanted to like these earbuds, but they have too many flaws. There are better choices out there at this or lower price points.Pros- Small, pocketable case- Good build quality. Solid Panasonic reputation.- Very comfortable ""Ergofit""- Minimal in-ear adjustment required after insertion. They stay in place pretty well for non-winged earbuds, but do require infrequent adjustments in my wonky ears.- Sound quality is very good, even without EQing. Balanced. Good ""XBS"" bass, good treble. Compared to Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, they rate 8/10 on sound.Cons- No wireless charging- A little awkward to get in and out of the case- No app support, which means no firmware updates to potentially improve them over time.- No app means no control customization.- No app means no EQ unless you use a 3rd-part EQ app like Wavelet, XEQ, or your music player's built-in EQ.- Cannot control volume from the earbuds, aside from summoning the digital assistant and asking it to turn the volume down. Cumbersome. Faster to just do it on your phone.- Controls are just OK. Sometimes you have to tap more than once to get them to register. And they seemed to respond more when I tapped below the visible sensor area than on it, but that's probably something I could adjust to in time.- ANC - The noise cancelling is just OK. It does work, and there is a marked difference between Off, Transparent Mode, and Noise Cancelling Mode. But it is not nearly as good as the Pixel Buds Pro, Liberty 3 Pro, or Earfun Free Pro 2.- Bluetooth connection stability. They have Bluetooth 5.3, as does my Pixel 7 phone. Despite un-pairing and re-pairing several times with my phone, they would frequently lose pairing, then re-pair. Sometimes they would not re-pair or re-connect without putting them back in the case and pulling them back out. During playback, they would have several very short interruptions or glitches per song. Very quick, like a record skipping, but still quite noticeable and aggravating. Sometimes when grasping the stem to adjust their fit in my ear, they lose connection and say ""pairing"". If buds can't stay connected, they are useless. I don't have these problems with other buds.- As is true with most buds, if they lose seal the sound quality degrades a lot. No bass, shrill treble, and no ANC because of outside sound leakage. You have to adjust them to get the seal and the bass back. But there's a 50/50 chance they'll lose connection when you grasp the stem to adjust.- Phone voice quality is just OK. The clarity is fine, but the volume is quiet. Callers have a hard time hearing me unless I speak quite loudly.I don't feel these buds are worth $100. They have a solid Panasonic brand name & build quality, but they offer too little for the money. A $50-65 price point is more realistic for these buds.Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro list for $169 but are frequently discounted to $129 or even $99.Earfun Free Pro 2 or Air Pro 3 are less than $99.Pixel Buds Pro list for $199 but are often on sale for $149.I would choose any of those over these Panasonics.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2023",AHO6IVLXFOSTQ3IH3LQPY7SUUWHA,0,2,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling,"May 12, 2023",2023-05-12,2023-05,Sony,Panasonic ErgoFit RZ-B310W - True Wireless Earbuds
R3CKS394UB0G6W,B0BZTCXG6T,"4.0 out of 5 stars Lots of bass, ANC, ambient mode, not the most comfortable.",Avid83,4.0,"These Panasonic earbuds are awesome for listening to music with deep bass. They connect easily to your iPhone or PC via Bluetooth and have a stable connection. They come with different sizes of rubber tips, but they could fit better in your ears. Maybe longer stems would help. Fortunately, these are lightweight, but not the most compact design.The earbuds have some cool features like noise cancelling, ambient mode, and a low latency mode called ‚Äúgame mode.‚Äù You can turn on game mode by tapping the earbuds 5 times quickly. It makes games and videos in sync, but sometimes it‚Äôs prone to dropouts. Active noise cancelling works well at reducing outside sounds, but also introduces some low but noticeable noise. I didn‚Äôt try exercising with these, but they do have an IPX4 water resistant rating.The touch sensors on these earbuds are not very responsive and have a delay. You have to get used to them and find the right spot to tap. You can't control the volume with them, but you can do other things like skip tracks, pause, answer calls, and use voice assistants. The earbuds don't fall out of your ears, but they do slip a bit over time and have to be readjusted. Battery life seems good, and the charging case uses a USB-C connection, although the included cable fits unusually tight.Although not perfect, these earbuds have a lot of modern features like ANC and a USB-C connection to charge the case.

Since Panasonic is a brand I grew up around, I had high hopes for these earbuds.These paired easily with my phone, and they're comfortable on my ears for their whole two and a half hour battery life.These earbuds are a pain to get out of the case, even with my small hands and somewhat long nails.The controls are AWFUL. They're difficult to master, rarely react the same way twice except to pause when I'm trying to skip, I cannot skip songs nor activate the ANC, and there's very little about the controls in the instruction booklet aside from a leaflet with mostly pictures- the other booklet is a European warranty that lacks a language that I can understand. I have no clue what the picture means for how to activate the ANC, so I gave up on that front. I can just barely get these to answer calls, so I don't bother. I use my phone's controls over the ones on these earbuds, they're so difficult to work with.I have to turn off my phone's bluetooth to disengage these earbuds from it.The volume on these is not stellar- at their max, I'm just barely satisfied with the volume, even when using VLC. Sometimes I want louder music to drown out construction work and the industrial-level banging at the nearby oil well- these cannot do that.However I do find that the sound is overall reasonably balanced, and the strength of the bass is adequate- but not great. The highs and mids are so-so: nothing to complain about, but the mids get muddy in certain ranges, and the highs are a tad too sharp at certain tones. I think that these are fine for casual use, but could be lacking for audiophiles.I can definitely say that I've used worse, but there's better earbuds out there.For a pair of earbuds from a such a well-known brand, these miss the mark.

They came off without too much issue but getting the new ones on...very tough.They didn't come off easy enough to worry about them popping off during normal wear and use but easy enough that I wasn't worried about tearing them.Pairing them was smooth and they quickly pair and disconnect when taken out and put away.The case is a nice slick black case that fits in the pocket and carges the buds nicely. I only wish there were covers for the case like with the Apple ones so that I can attach them to my lanyard like I do the Apple ones.I use these mainly as my work ear buds while away from the desk and the sound is perfect, I can be heard from other parties loud and clear and the volume on the buds for me works.They feel like they are about to slip out of my ears some times but they don't so i think I'm just used to using the AirPods where they fit inside more. Either that or I need to actually move to a smaller silicone piece.Been using these for some time now and after the initial full charge I haven't had to charge the case yet. I'd say that I've been using them for at least 3 to 4 hours per week and it's been at least three or four weeks since I have charged the case.Overall I'd give them a good rating on almost every aspect. They do cancel out some of the noise but not all of it unless the volume is turned up all the way.

Bass is deep and wonderfully real sounding, not overwhelming, just right. Mids are... well, they're there just where they need to be for 95% of people (more or less) to absolutely LOVE this sound signature.ERGONOMICS: feels like they are copied from some other earbuds but it's not a bad thing.

Understated, Panasonic logo on the side. Perfect!CASE: this is the weakest point. Another example of pointless vertical case design that makes it super annoyingly difficult to take the earbuds out.

R2RSE6UHEK6L69,B0863H1JKB,1.0 out of 5 stars First ever disappointment with Panasonic,M. Hoffman,1.0,"I am 73 years of age and have been purchasing Panasonic products since I was in college. Transistor radios, boom boxes, Technics components, telephones, plasma tv (still working more than 10 years old), etc, etc. Most recently I purchased two pairs of Wings bluetooth earbuds. They worked well, BUT their life seemed relatively short. I am still attempting to determine what a reasonable life is for bluetooth earbuds. Now, I purchased these ""true wireless"" (?) earbuds twice. The first pair did not charge. The second pair which I kept has many, many problems with the sensors, maintaining bluetooth connection, etc. When they work, they work well, but it was a full two weeks until the full volume kicked in and that occurred unexpectedly after multiple beeping, changes of volume, cutout, noise setting, etc, etc. Last night was the first time they worked relatively flawlessly until I arrived back home after a two hour walk. They began cutting out again. Considering that I could have bought innumerable cheaper bluetooth earbuds of other manufacturers and far less expensive, it is disappointing. I sincerely hope this is not a continuing problem with Panasonic products. Their customer service is also difficult. As an example, although the directions say you should use ONLY the power cord supplied for charging, the customer service said I could use any generic USB C cord. He had no explanation for the directions. They also fall out of your ears. I am at the end of my rope with these things. Going back. I reset them with the app, explored all attempts to remedy the problems, but they are just too frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2021",AFBMBLTASTCHRQT6H2FUSQGWBM3A,1,9,Color: White,"August 4, 2021",2021-08-04,2021-08,JBL,JBL Clip 3 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R3O2F0G4RQELXK,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Movement focused TW earbuds from Beats with great sound,Ant,5.0,"My pair of Beats Powerbeats Pros were starting to die out on me. I had purchased them secondhand so I wasn‚Äôt too upset, but I needed a replacement. I decided to get a new pair of true wireless earbuds this time around.After doing some research on the top recommended workout focused true wireless earbuds, it came down to the Beats Fit Pro and the Beats Studio Buds.Ultimately I decided on the more expensive of the two, thinking it would be worth the extra cost. I got them on a sale that was running here which makes it even better. My use case for them would be for gym workouts such as jogging/walking and lifting, and also for casual use at work and home.I‚Äôve had this pair for a little over 1 year and 6 months. I have purchased Apple care + for them but have not had to use it.EXPERIENCE:The sound on these, personally, is really enjoyable! The noise cancelling and transparency mode work so well.If I‚Äôm at the gym and don‚Äôt want to hear the other people making noise with their machines or the running of treadmills? Turn on noise cancelling and have music on. In a snap, the outside noises seem to be gone.At work and don‚Äôt want to miss a phone call?Turn on transparency mode and you‚Äôre free to hear sounds around you. Even better with just one earbud in, too.The mic quality on calls seems to be passable, people seem to hear me fine.*Small note: there is a tiny rip in the silicone/plastic on the right bud‚Äôs button near the bottom. I suspect this is from wearing them when going to bed sometimes. I usually wake up and find them out of my ears. There are times where they‚Äôre still in my ears, but I tend to move around during when asleep.OTHER THOUGHTS:I really like the wing tips on the earbuds, they stay in my ears perfectly. Sure, there was some soreness in my ears in the beginning, but my ears got used to it pretty fast. Also, the ear tip size helps a lot. Make sure you try all the included sizes to really figure out which one is most comfortable.There is definitely a learning curve on inserting the earbuds into your ears. Once you get the method of inserting them smoothly and creating the right seal, they are more enjoyable. Look at one of the animations in the earbud‚Äôs description for reference.Plus, the sage grey colorway just looks dope. Wish there was a lava red colorway available like the Powerbeats Pro.These work great with my iPhone and connected to my PC. Can‚Äôt speak for performance on an Android device. I am perfectly happy with this purchase!(Pictured is the earbuds, with an aftermarket cover on the case to protect from accidental damage)","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AFHZTD2L5OXDW2RC4GDSIBRMAB6A,1,78,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"March 8, 2024",2024-03-08,2024-03,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R2LFEEQXQDETXR,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Apple Ecosystem Option for Running,C. Godby,4.0,"Before buying the Beats Fit Pro, I've owned the PowerBeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2. I'm a runner that wants an Apple ecosystem option that has decent sound quality and won't fall out of my ear. After two runs and a trip to the gym, I'm happy with them so far. Out of the three options above, I consider them the best option for running. My quick thoughts on each:The PowerBeats Pro has been out for two or three years now and I'm surprised there hasn't been an updated model. They're good earbuds for runners...when they work. And the when they work part is infuriating. The earbuds have to line up perfectly with the charging connections in the case or they won't charge. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use them and found one fully charged and the other dead. There was even a potential class action lawsuit filed against Apple on that (search for it). When they work, the PowerBeats Pro are solid because they hook around your ear. You can have confidence when you run they're not going to fall out - I never had an issue in the two years or so I owned them with that. There is also a physical button for changing songs and pausing the music and a rocker for changing the volume, which is convenient. Cons: sound quality is ho hum in my opinion - it never feels like they secure cleanly in your ear. Also, there's no wireless charging or noise cancellation. Oh, and of course the infuriating charging issues. I would not buy the PowerBeats Pro again for that reason.On to the AirPods Pro 2. These earbuds have better sound quality in my opinion than both the PowerBeats Pro and Beats Fit Pro. The noise cancellation meaningfully improved from gen 1 to gen 2. There's wireless charging and a speaker installed in the case so you can ping them using the ""find my"" app on your iPhone. For day to day use around the home or office, these earbuds are awesome. However, at least for me, they're not for running. While more secure than the regular AirPods, they still fall out of my ears sometimes and that certainly applies to running. If you buy after market rubber hooks, Air Pods Pro 2 (and 1) will stay secure when running and provide a good experience (they don't fall out). That said, having to attach the rubber hooks each time you go to run is a pain in the butt.The Beats Fit Pro makes some compromises, but in my opinion it's the best option for runners based on my limited experience so far. The rubber wing tips ensure that the Beats Fit Pro has a secure fit in your ear. They've felt secure running and haven't fallen out in my experience so far. There's a physical button for changing the song, activating noise cancellation, and pausing the music. Versus the PowerBeats Pro, there's no rubber hook so they're not as secure and there's no volume rocker. However, they do have noise cancellation and fit more snugly in your ear. As a result, I think the sound quality is a little better than the PowerBeats Pro, but not as good as the AirPods Pro 2. On the downside, I think the case feels cheap compared to the AirPods, there's no wireless charging, and there's no speaker on the case for the ""find my"" app. In addition, the case charges using USB C instead of lightning (btw, it's a USB C to USB C cable included with them and there's no power brick included). USB C is coming to iPhone and I believe is already on iPad, but it's irritating that it has a USB C cable instead of lightning when your life revolves around lightning cables.In short, avoid the Powerbeats Pro - the charging issue is a design flaw and will lead to frustration over time. The AirPods Pro 2 are awesome, but they're not a good option for running since they will fall out of many people's ears. The Beats Fit Pro makes compromises, but in my experience so far its the best Apple ecosystem earbud for running.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AHYLFTWLZ5YY5FWN3UBI4YSR3ROQ,1,260,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"February 8, 2023",2023-02-08,2023-02,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R35IQTO062Y7LU,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far,theInternational,5.0,"I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable ""boom boom"" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this ""boom boom"" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some ""boom boom"" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the ""boom boom"" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal ""boom boom"" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more ""boom boom"" than the wired Bose Headphones, the ""boom boom"" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation ""button"" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. The AirPods Pro ""button"" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AHJD4656VLR6I3TCW544TITKJBUQ,1,769,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 13, 2022",2022-07-13,2022-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

There was no break in period at all. They feel just right. If you have medium to large ears and are looking for ear buds to workout in, these are the ones.The sound quality, and built in Beats equalizer curve could certainly be better.

REDXSAP527XVD,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5.0,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,486,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 11, 2022",2022-08-11,2022-08,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R28ZWVS937ZQTG,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the most comfortable,Theo,4.0,"The **Beats Fit Pro** is a versatile pair of true wireless earbuds that caters to both Android and iPhone users. Let's dive into the details:1. **Audio Quality (5/5):** The standout feature of the **Fit Pro** is its impressive sound quality. The bass is punchy, mids are clear, and highs are well-defined. Whether you're at the gym or in the office, the audio experience is top-notch.2. **Comfort and Fit (4/5):** The earbuds come with an intuitive ear tip fit test, ensuring a snug fit. However, some users may find the wing tips a bit uncomfortable during extended wear. If you're okay with shorter sessions, the comfort level is decent.3. **Noise Cancellation (4/5):** The active noise cancellation (ANC) works effectively, blocking out ambient noise. It's not on par with premium ANC headphones, but it gets the job done.4. **Design and Build (4/5):** The Fit Pro's rounded housings and tapered wing tips give them a unique look. The case is compact and easy to carry. However, the chunky earpieces might not appeal to everyone.5. **Price (3/5):** Here's where the Fit Pro falls short. At $199.99 USD, they're on the pricey side. If they were a tad more affordable, they'd easily earn that fifth star.In summary, the **Beats Fit Pro** delivers excellent audio quality and comfort, but the price tag holds it back from perfection.

R3OU5G5RXBTK3T,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, Something By Beats I Can Endorse",Jeff Gomske,5.0,"I work in radio. I've done it for 30+ years and one of the curses/blessings of working with audio is I have grown to understand intimately what really good audio sounds like. I have used countless number of headphones and earbuds (and there ùôÑùôé a difference between the two) and there are a few names which stand above the rest, and I'm not going to get into a debate because so-called, 'Audiophiles' will claim they know better (Which begs the question, how does one actually ùôóùôöùôòùô§ùô¢ùôö an Audiophile in the first place? Is there a course you can take, or does one simply give themselves that title? But I digress...) when Beats first hit the scene, they were unquestionably an astonishing waste of money. Their audio quality was maybe a shade above average at best. But, that didn't stop millions of people from buying them at outrageous prices. Well, the uncontested King of over-priced products (apple) got wind of this and did a takeover of their products and an interesting thing happened: their quality got BETTER.Did they become as good as most ""professional"" headphones out there...? Probably not. However, their earbuds did become notably better. I feel it necessary to point out that while Beats headphones were nowhere as good as many claimed, their earbuds from the beginning seemed to be pretty good from the get-go. Their unique ""hook"" style which wrapped around your ear for a secure fit (you either love this style or not - but you cannot argue that they did not fit and stay in place better than almost any other brand out there). Some of their other wired earbuds were still decent as well, if not priced at the upper end of what most people were willing to pay, but at least the earbuds could be counted on to give you an above average experience.Apple buys them out and reorganizes the entire company. Suddenly they are no longer all over the place like they used to be. Famous people were no longer wearing them everywhere you looked. Then apple releases their Beats branded earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro. Love them or hate them, they made an impact.They were also equipped with apple tech like their H1 chip which made them instantly compatible with iPhones (a pretty smart move, actually) and the audio was excellent, especially for working out. Then they release the Beats Fit Pro.A radically different design. But - a welcome one, especially for someone who loved the Powerbeats great audio quality, but not the hook design. Again, it's hard to please everyone when it comes to something that fits inside your ears that have so many different possible sizes and an almost infinite number of differences from one person to the next...like the apple airpods, one size fit ùô¢ùô§ùô®ùô©...and if you were one of the people they did not fit, well you were kind of SOL. At least with the Fit Pro they opened up better fitting to a much larger segment than the airpods and with the included wing-tip design, they immediately caught the eye of many athletes who need earbuds which stay put while sometimes being fairly aggressive in their workouts. If you were not a fan of the Powerbeats hook style, the Fit Pro's must have looked like a gift from On High.FIrst off, they really DO sound great. Good bass without going too deep. Music NEEDS good bass, but if it thumps too hard, it will ruin audio in more ways than I can describe here. Mids and Highs were also both pretty crisp and not overly isolated. The blend just works. Whoever tuned the Fit Pro should be commended for doing such a great job.ANC was...disappointing. To be fair, to get great ANC into such a tiny device really IS a challenge and oftentimes going all-in on this feature usually means you sacrifice audio quality. In this case, Beats chose to put more into the audio than into the ANC. I had a difficult time even recognizing that it was even turned on at all. Maybe my pair simply isn't doing it's job. However, the OnePlus buds Z2 has ANC that is actually pretty good and still has really impressive audio as well, so I'm not exactly sure why the Fit Pro's is so difficult to even tell if ANC is on or off, but I can only review what I have and that seems to be the case with my particular pair.The wing-tip design really works well - for me at least. They provide a pretty good fit and they stay put incredibly well. My biggest problem with earbuds is exactly that. Either they'll fit well, or almost not at all. It doesn't seem to fall anywhere in between. My OnePlus buds Z2 sound great, but I constantly find myself adjusting them in my ears - which honestly is annoying. The Fit Pro's (at least in my case) I set them in, twist to secure the wing-tip and they just stay put. This is going to be subjective since everyone is slightly different, so keep in mind my experience with how they fit in my ear may not mirror your own.You can do a little customizing with the app. I do have an iPhone but I primarily use an android, so I downloaded the app and you can to a bit of customizing, however, not as much as I would have liked to have seen given what these earbuds are capable of. I believe the iPhone integration has quite a bit more options than the android counterpart. This seems to be more the norm these days as apple and Samsung work hard to reward you for buying products that are more in line with their products than the competition. I wish they'd both put an end to this childish bickering and open up all their products that can be used on other platforms to include all the options that they would have if you paired it with an iPhone or a Samsung. Either you want your customers to get the best bang for their buck or not.I like the physical buttons the Fit Pro uses. You'll know by touch that you've pressed it instead of simply the ""touch"" controls which in my experience can be hit or miss. When they work great, it's awesome. But do they all work perfectly every time? Of course not. With buttons, they seem to work pretty much 100% of the time and that's something I appreciate.No wireless charging. At this point, especially for the cost, that really is something they should have included. Is it a deal breaker? For some it very well could be. It wasn't for me, but I love wireless charging and think every pair of wireless earbuds over $100 really ought to include it. I know earbuds that cost under $40 that do, so to not include it here seems to be almost an insult. They use USB-C charging which IS convenient however. Beats claims they have fast charging however, in fact they call it ""Fast Fuel"" where just 5 minutes of charging will net you an hour of listening...I haven't been able to check this, but I CAN state that they do seem to charge pretty quick, so that may negate some of the disappointment of not having wireless ability, but necessarily so.The case is pretty nice, too. It is quite a bit smaller than the case for the Powerbeats, but still larger than what you get with the airpods. I honestly didn't mind the size at all, so this one is also going to be pretty subjective.For the most part, these are the first apple made earbuds that I can recommend even if you own an android device. The audio is stellar and they seem to hold a charge for about an average length of time for earbuds of this size. I rarely listen for more than about an hour, maybe 2 at the most, so I'm not the guy to look for with advice on listening at length (unless it's for headphones, then I can make a LOT of recommendations). Honestly, I'm happy with mine. Are they perfect? No. But are they worth it? I sure think so.***UPDATE***I purchased some memory foam eartips...not sure that this was a wise decision. Not because they don't work or fit well, but because they are slightly larger, it means fitting them back into the charging case either they won't charge or they'll be problematic to fit properly. Now, in all fairness, this wasn't an issue with the smallest foam eartips, but the medium and larger ones did not like to fit back into the case. They also did not really make any noticeable difference is audio quality, so I switched back to the original tips they came with. Lesson learned.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AHJED44JHCW4ATDA2K2MQRWPZQ7A,1,558,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"March 22, 2023",2023-03-22,2023-03,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R14J76DRBT8EHE,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, great features, but missing one important feature",J. Sierra,4.0,"I'll start by stating that I appreciate and recognize great quality audio, and certainly prefer the highest quality audio that I can reasonably get when I'm listening to headphones and/or earbuds. That being said, the important word here is ""reasonably"", and I don't have tremendous expectations from earbuds that are also intended for working out, etc. it's just not reasonable to expect to compare them to over-ear headphones, in terms of quality or features. Noise cancellation, bass response, highs, mids.... Over-ear are always going to edge out earbuds. There's just more space to make it all work.Ok that's out of the way. I didn't have huge expectations and I wasn't even convinced that the buds would be worth the $150 (they were on sale when I bought them.) I'm not convinced *any* ear bud is worth more than $100, and I've tried some very ""high-end"" units.So I pulled the trigger with some hesitation, received them, charged them up, paired em to my phone after downloading the proprietary Beats app (didn't like that, but there's good news), popped em in (after trying the different sized ends) and went on a run (because I feel like that constant bouncing is the likeliest to cause them to fall out.)I was.... Extremely surprised. Surprised and a little impressed. Sound quality is actually really, really good... Far better than I would've expected from a Beats product, more akin to the high quality Sony and Technics units. There are two ""modes"", sound-cancelling and transparency mode (transparency mode allows for awareness of what's going on around you by almost enhancing ambient noise.) Noise cancellation is surprisingly good, though yes, okay, not the absolute best I've heard but it's in the top 3 for ear buds, no question. It's effective, even if it eats battery up like crazy. I appreciate transparency mode though - especially while running or biking. It's not disturbing to have the ambient noise available and there's a safety component there that can't be overstated. And it works really well.Pairing them up was a little... Interesting. They're clearly designed by and for Apple people, so if you're rocking that Apple tech the process is probably mostly automated (that's as advertised) but with Android you theoretically have you use a Beats app. At first that aggravated me (I really hate proprietary apps) but then the pairing failed and I discovered that I could indeed pair via Bluetooth, it's super fast and easy, and the Beats app just gives me a handy place to activate some features/controls. I can't speak to the Apple experience though.Charging is where I was actually disappointed enough to take a star off the product. The case is ok, has cool little magnets to keep the buds in place, but it only works as a charging station when plugged in. No wireless charging. That's a huge miss for Beats. Huge. There are a ton of comparable products at that price profile and all of them offer wireless charging. It's maybe not a deal breaker and they do have ok battery life but it's... Extremely disappointing. Battery life is going to depend a lot on whether you use noise cancellation or not. Kind of a big fluctuation there, ymmv, maybe not the best but definitely far from the worst. They certainly last well beyond exercise sessions, and are capable of giving most of your day music. Again though, lack of wireless charging is blatantly, conspicuously missing. And it's annoying because if it had wireless charging the battery life would almost become inconsequential. Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, there are actually aftermarket cases that do have wireless charging, giving you approximately three days worth of charge. It's an extra thirty bucks so it's something you'll want to keep in mind/consider as part of ownership. Don't get me wrong, it's not a deal breaker - there's plenty of battery life - but it's one of those things that premium buds should have. Period. And these are supposed to be premium buds.The fit is exceptionally comfortable. There are several tips that help with sealing but also support the stability in the ear while doing exercise. After a run/jog session they stayed in without any issues. Even with plenty of sweat, they were good to go. The extra little fin protrusion also contributed effectively to it staying in and in place. I would have been more surprised at this but I've been using ear bud hearing protection recently and they're so light and well fitting that I know what good buds are capable of in this particular domain.The features are actually pretty neat, but mostly expected, like swapping automatically from buds to phone and back again, going single-bud with nary a hiccup, and plenty more. They're pretty slick in functionality. The buttons are also tactile, providing a neat click; seems like a little thing but from an interface perspective it's a surprisingly big deal, and it works really well.So, are they good? I think that they're overpriced but I think all ear buds these days are so, grain of salt. I think they're very very good buds, they exceeded my admittedly mid expectations, they function flawlessly and most importantly: they deliver great sound. Would I buy them for two bills? Eh.... Knowing what I know now about them and how good they are, that goes from a hard no to a soft maybe. At $150ish I think they're a decent value. Are they better than over ear options? Not in terms of sheer quality no, but: they're a million times better for exercise and working out. Unless you like being one of those douchey gym rats with the Beats over-ear. Then I can't help you.For the rest of us, these are a very fine choice. Sony and Technics have offerings that actually do have intensely high quality audio, but these come close enough in terms of audio and they're good for a sweaty, bouncy, jouncy session of your favorite exercise, whatever that might be.As always, ymmv. But hey, with Amazon if you don't like em, you can just return them. Hopefully my review helped a little.Merry Christmas!","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023",AHG4U7VZCV63NJNZUKLWXRXUFIKQ,1,25,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 26, 2023",2023-12-26,2023-12,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R33EWBK9B5WOQ6,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars My New Daily Driver,Dylan Geuss,5.0,"I really like these a lot, I got them through Amazon Resale for a much cheaper price, however they were still basically brand new, so I feel like I lucked out on these puppies! For the longest time I've struggled with finding earbuds that are able to stay in my ear without the fear of feeling them slowly slipping out overtime, thanks to the amazing wingtips! Every other earbuds I have bought and used over the years did not have wingtips, and as a result, due to the shape of my ears, they would eventually fall out after doing so much as just walking with them in.I'm not audiophile, but these sound great, very comparable to my Pixel Buds Pro in terms of quality, albeit with less options for tuning the sound to your tastes, but that's not something I concern myself too much with anyway, since for me personally, I don't need many options other than just wanting them to work and sound good out of the box. There's plenty of bass, but it's not so much that it overwhelms everything else about the sound, when listening to music anyway.These were able to pair to my phone pretty easily once I downloaded the Beats app from the Play Store, and setup is about as simple as it gets! Open the case, tap the sync button, and boom, you're off to the races! Bluetooth is very stable from the time I've used them so far, no random disconnects or audio garbling as far as I can tell.These come with their own USB-C cable for charging, and it's just like any other earbuds that charge the same way, and although the lack of wireless charging is apparent, it was never something I used much anyway, so for me, I'm fine with plugging these in when the juice gets low. In terms of how far these reach while in use, they seem to have a range of about 30 feet or so, I was able to walk around my apartment while using them and they had no issues staying connected.Overall, these are a great pair, definitely consider picking them up for yourself if you've had issues with more typical earbuds staying secure in your ears. I got a much better deal on these than the standard price, but even still, I think these are worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AGMVDVBKAEDITJJDXFU7WCH4TSUQ,1,0,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 26, 2024",2024-07-26,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R1PTVZ5IJ2ZL6,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for Apple ecosystem - not fully convinced at price point,decadeindc,4.0,"UPDATE 17 Feb 2024: Had to buy another pair after 13 months. The takeaway is: clean your earbuds thoroughly every 3-4 weeks with a earbud cleaning tool. There is a small screen on the little earbud sound exit point that‚Äôs visible when the ear tip is removed. That screen came entirely off on one earbud and the other earbud was partially blocked from impacted ear wax that had hardened so much that it fused to the screen (which is fragile and not attached to the housing with much glue). I cleaned the silicone tips regularly, but never cleaned those small openings and screens, much to my peril. (And yes, I clean my ears daily.) The earbuds still technically work ok, but without those screens in place, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before additional ear wax begins to change the sound and eventually corrode or block the drivers.Otherwise, my year-plus of experience with these earbuds was great. I used them for a minimum of an hour every day, and often much longer. They fit comfortably, produce great sound, hold good battery life, easily connect to all my Apple devices. I misjudged the battery life in my original review. Transparency mode is fine and noise canceling is good, although I‚Äôm not sure the trade off with battery life from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù mode is always worth it. The trade off of wired USB-C charging and no wireless charging is something I can live with. Don‚Äôt think any earbud is comfortable enough to wear all day on conference calls, but certainly around four hours is fine. I‚Äôve experienced more than a few instances where the sound stops playing via my iPhone randomly and it looks like the Bluetooth connection has severed. I can‚Äôt just press on the left earbud to start playing again, I have to physically press play on my iPhone app and magically the earbuds start working again. Hard to tell what the problem is, but it happens once a week or so. Still think the price/value ratio is about as good as any other wireless earbud, especially in the Apple ecosystem, including AirPods.Original review ‚Ä¶ Pros: comfy for in-ear buds, especially for physical activity, works really nicely with Apple‚Äôs ecosystem including spatial audio, noise cancellation is very good as is transparency mode, sound quality is decent, can use one bud at a time if desired, USB-C charging. Cons: no multipoint connectivity, no wireless charging, water resistance rating lower than many other earbuds, battery life is barely adequate (both buds and charging case), outgoing audio voice quality is also just adequate.These are good earbuds, no question. But there are some maddening features skipped here that appear on much less expensive Bluetooth products. I still don‚Äôt understand why Apple‚Äôs Bluetooth audio products don‚Äôt include multipoint connectivity, even within their own ecosystem. My ancient Plantronics ear piece and my Bose headphones have had multipoint for years, and lack of it is really annoying when using the Beats for work purposes. Lack of wireless charging is less a concern for me, but is annoying at this price point if you‚Äôve invested in the technology. The outgoing voice quality is probably fine for the form factor of the Beats, but it does sound like a telephone call when using Teams or Zoom rather than high quality audio. Biggest bug for me is these won‚Äôt make it through a full eight hour day of calls without a recharge, and the case only holds enough charge for 35 hours of use. I have a pair of Anker Life Dot 2s that are 5.5x less expensive with a 100 hour case that isn‚Äôt really any bigger. I realize many other buds won‚Äôt hit that eight hour mark either, so maybe it‚Äôs a complaint about the form factor.The sound quality is fine considering the Bluetooth codec used by Apple (either source or headphone) isn‚Äôt high def or even CD quality, despite what Apple might want you to think with the inclusion of spatial audio capability on the Beats. The drivers on the Beats are certainly acceptable for most users and given the mission and price point of the Beats, it‚Äôs about as good as anybody should expect. There‚Äôs room for improvement, but not much more without moving up in price or a change in codec use by Apple.One thing I did expect was a better water resistance rating. IPX4 is a little weak considering iPhones are at IP67.What I do really like is the noise cancellation (and transparency mode done well) of the Beats. Really works well. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and get a good seal. The ear wings hold the earbuds in the ear without turning uncomfortable. Love the Apple ecosystem integration - these connect very easily with simple adjustments to iPhone and MacBook Pro alike.If you like the idea of AirPods Pro that fit better and stay in your ear more securely, you‚Äôll probably like these. Again, for the price, these seem to hit most marks for what they are, which is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades Bluetooth earbud. Be sure to shop around if you value one specific element over another, like audio quality or battery life.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2023",AH553ARDDAOXIY2C5AOXI34LGJQA,1,53,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"January 8, 2023",2023-01-08,2023-01,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
RCBPKVDSLY4O2,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Earbuds,AJ Harris,5.0,"Great earbuds. Only thing is I had to get them serviced, by Apple, not even a month in because of some defection that caused them to randomly screech then one went out. Took about a 3-4 week turnaround for Apple to send them off, because they don't have the parts and analysis tools in store to test them. The repair took a hot second because they had to order a part for it but all in all, with Apple Care, you're taken care of. Since I got them back, they have been great. They can fit to any ear and will not fall out because of the holder that keeps it attached to your ear. Noise cancelling is great, and quality is definitely there. If you're in the market for some good earbuds for everything, including working out, these are for you, if you don't mind spending a little bit more.The charging is case is a tad bulky bit it's cool at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AHVDWMAGSYK7TILBU63O7PEMN24A,1,0,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 19, 2024",2024-07-19,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
RCUUN4FL47CDU,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Positives/Negatives,CR,4.0,"I purchased Beats Pro for a couple of reasons: First, I felt they would provide a more secure fit than my AirPod pros. Second, they promised seamless compatibility with Apple products. The device has fulfilled both of these conditions. Additionally, Beats offers ample battery life and reasonably good sound quality (I don‚Äôt listen to music very much, so the sound assessment is based upon podcasts and audio books and seminars).Now some negatives: First, the noise cancellation is notably less robust than the AirPods Pro. This deficiency combined with the volume limits of the Beats renders them far less useable in noisier environments such as outdoors near traffic and in airports. Second, the case is significant larger than the AirPod‚Äôs. With the size, and the smooth roundness, as well as the clamshell opening, I find I drop the case frequently. The smaller AirPod‚Äôs case and the different way it opens, have made for more secure handling in the two or three years I‚Äôve owned the AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AGRVHRQ24NRJJWBYKGAJMBE7KFCA,1,1,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 17, 2024",2024-07-17,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R1ALB57R90GVZ0,B09JL41N9C,2.0 out of 5 stars Unimpressive,Sean,2.0,"So, I don't know what to think about tech reviewers these days... they all seem to be sponsored now.I got the Beats Pro Fit due to high reviews on sites by critics, rather than just individual input.I have small ears that I frequently have everything pop out when mowing, etc. Pretty much only the Air Pods sit comfortably, or a Sony in ear monitor from 15 years ago. I wanted to try these out for their wingtips to keep them in and, well, extremely let down in every way.2 stars for sound quality. They sound tinny and low quality, like I bought 15 dollar buds at a gas station when I listen to podcasts and youtube. Any standard speech. I did not try them with movies, but music was also a letdown. They were FAR worse than my Jbird Vistas in every way on sound quality. By far, these Beats Pro Fit are the worse audio quality of any bud I have tried in 15 years over the 50 dollar price point and these are 200. Absolutely terrible for audiophiles.I kinda laughed when my dad said friends don't let friends buy beats, they are just so bad.The music STARTED to approach something rich, but it was interfered too much with its attempt to be sound silencing. It seemed like there were supposed to be settings adjusted to bring out a rich sound experience, but the controls just weren't there and its automatic settings, terrible. I don't know if they are simply low quality like others have stated, or cannot live up to their potential with the software control suite.It was the software control suite that people hate with Sony and Bose that prevented me from buying them instead...1 star comfort. If I wear these for an hour everything about the experience is unpleasant. They are also the singularly least comfortable buds I have ever worn. They feel cheap and hard. The sound silencing pushes too hard into my ear instead of creating a seal. All in all, headaches and ear aches after very little time on these. I have never experienced ear fatigue this fast before.3 stars fit. The wingtips seem to work, they aren't great and push the bud into an awkward angle causing more fatigue. But at least I didn't have to re-adjust when mowing the lawn, even if 1 felt a little loose. They aren't truly secure for my ear shape, which is small and shallow. But the wingtip did keep them in. I don't know that I would trust running, jumping jacks, going upside down in these, anything raucus, although that is their purpose.4 star connectivity. Potentially 5 star controls. Connectivity has been superior to my Sony WH 1000XM4, WAY better than my attempt with the Seinheisser bluetooth headphones I had to replace last year with the WH 1000XM4s. The controls are superior to any other bluetooth I have had over the years. Definitely their best draw is their controls and connectivity/digital stability.I just absolutely would not get them if audio quality is your first, comfort your second. Sound silencing is not important to me nor desired as it almost always compromises comfort and quality. I don't know why we have an obsession with pushing all sound out with IEMs when headphones are more prime for that. We need a good seal, a comfortable seat, and high quality drivers. Not a sound silencing air push into our ear drums to try to override our sense of external sounds.The most comfortable listening experience to date were some open back Seinheisser wired headphones. A good quality listen, not the best, but exceedingly comfortable for endless listening and not feeling totally isolated and cut off from surroundings (I don't like not knowing what is going on around me, it makes me uncomfortable, I don't need a sensory deprivation music session in public places, I'll do that in my room to recharge).Overall I give this product a 2.5 stars due to outstanding controls and connectivity. Although I will post as 2 stars as those weight FAR less than quality and comfort for me personally.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFBXBLF7WBIYIUHMMQWDRF2WUFFQ,1,0,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 29, 2024",2024-07-29,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R10AOMN7EKJ0R0,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Slightly shy of perfection,VrunaS,4.0,"I have been using these for two days but tested the features extensible during that time so I thought I would share my thoughts if they help anyone.I wanted a pair of good earbuds for working out as well as extensive daily use- I listen to quite a bit of music as well as podcasts while I work. I have used Bose Soundsport wireless earbuds as my go to earbuds for the past 5 years and they finally are starting to reach the end of their life. Hence I decided that this prime day would be a good day to treat my ears to something nice.Overall I love these beats fit pro. They are super comfortable as other reviewers have pointed out to the point that if I wasn‚Äôt listening to anything on the earbuds I would possibly forget they were in my ears. Even though I loved them I wasn‚Äôt convinced they were worth the price until later today when I tried earbuds that were half the price and I hated them.As far as the features go here is what I feel-PROS:1. Super comfortable!! They might as well be the most comfortable earbuds I have ever used. What is surprising is the all the tips fit my ears well and feel comfortable. Even the largest tips that came with the earbud are super comfortable and don‚Äôt feel like they are stretching my ear canal- which is something I have never experienced before.2. Super secure in the ears- the wingtips hold them snug in the ear. They don‚Äôt budge even with the most intense activity. The earbuds are super low profile against the ears and not bulky or heavy at all. This enhances their comfort even more.3. Great music quality- I tested sounds from different genres and the songs that are suppose to be bass heavy (Get Lucky by Daft Punk for eg) do have a very nice skull shaking bass but in a very good way and without sacrificing the highs and mediums. Just as a point of reference (and because great quality can be a very subjective description)- the audio quality is very comparable to the one with the Bose Soundsport wireless earphones- the bass is just a hair better though.4. Earbuds appear in ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù- I love that I can potentially track where my earbuds are if I every lost them as long as they have a charge. They can also play a sound using the ‚Äúfind my‚Äù app to help you locate them. As a person who is constantly forgetting where I put things once I am home, this is going to serve me really well!5. Love having Siri compatible with the buds- Siri reading out my messages to me the past two days has been pretty fun and useful- Siri does interrupt your audio content jot announce messages (which my Bose never did) but this also means I won‚Äôt miss urgent texts while I am at work and not staring at my phone.CONS:1. ANC: it‚Äôs not absolute or the best out there although not a very critical point for me. I jump scare easily and so having something that completely cancels all background noise is not something I desire. I mean honestly for me the ANC is good enough- it completely gets rids of all low hums and mechanical noises‚Äî I was sitting next to my loud AC and with the ANC on it was whisper quiet. But I could still hear my husband speaking when he was near me and I could still hear the songs they were playing the gym if my own music was on a lower volume. So it doesn‚Äôt completely drown out all noise if that‚Äôs what you need. Again while the ANC for these is adequate for me- the only reason I put it as a con is because at this price point and considering ANC seems to be one of their major selling points I would have thought it would be better.2. Spatial Audio- this feature just seems like a waste for me. Although it‚Äôs personal preference I guess. With this feature it seems like the sound is coming from a specific point a few inches from my face- as if I were attending a live concert and inches away from the performer/band- and if I turn my head it does seem to track pretty well in that sense. However when I listen to music I would like it to be a completely immersive experience as if the sound is coming from inside my head not a fixed point out of my body. So for me I think it‚Äôs a pretty useless setting- at least for me.3. The case seems to be open easily in a bag or purse. The magnets holding the case closed are weaker than expected. Although I am not worried about the earphones automatically falling out of the case even if the case opens. The attachment of the earbuds to the case is very strong.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AGEAS25333CRQMSXOQ6ZP2UJXGTQ,1,179,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 15, 2023",2023-07-15,2023-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

The fit is more secure in the ears and better for exercise, but it might take you a little while to get used to them. At first, it feels like they're not all the way in, but still, the fit is secure, and I have never had a problem with them falling out. They use the same chip as the AirPods, so you still get features like transparency, noise reduction, spatial audio, Find My integration, etc., just like the AirPods Pro. However, the charging case does not support wireless charging like the Apple cases do.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AF4LGKPW2GSE7VKL46NJFU3Z6GAQ,1,0,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 30, 2024",2024-07-30,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R3BJQEGT2UE1HS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than Apple AirPod Pro,P.S.,4.0,"After my Apple AirPods stopped working, I was looking for a replacement and found these. Since they work with the Apple ecosystem, I figured I‚Äôd give them a shot. I bought them on sale and was floored by the noise cancellation and comfort. I hated the AirPods how they‚Äôd move if knocked around a little bit. A year later the Beats battery life shortened and one ear bud would not charge as fast as the other so I threw them away and bought a new pair. It‚Äôs now been a year later with the new set and they‚Äôre doing the same thing. It frustrates me because I love these, but they seem to be only good for a year.I decided to buy a pair of Apple AirPod Pros in hopes that maybe they‚Äôd be the new replacement. I didn‚Äôt like the odd fit they have, but thought I‚Äôd live with it if they were better, but the sound quality was so tinny compared to the Beats that I returned them the next day. Maybe it was a bad pair of AirPod Pros, but I couldn‚Äôt believe the difference in sound quality. I‚Äôll gives these another month and buy them again, but with Apple Care so they can be replaced after they stop charging properly.These are great earbuds, but only if you get Apple Care and know you‚Äôll have to replace them every year.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AG7G3DOT5A47QVQHQS7DF33SBI2A,1,0,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 18, 2024",2024-06-18,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R38UJJJXRBSZ9H,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, secure fit",Sherry Young,4.0,"I bought these buds to replace my (1st gen) Powerbeats Pros. What I was looking for in an upgrade was better sound, better fit, and sound cancellation. The Beats Fit Pros largely delivered.I had the Powerbeats for almost 4 years, and they were fine. The sound was okay. The fit was secure, and comfortable on their own but not when wearing glasses. They were a little hard to put on, and they had a tendency for one of the buds to fail to charge that drove me crazy. So - the price reduction on the Beats Fit Pros convinced me that it was time to try something else.The Beats Fit Pros are easy to put in my ears, and plenty secure for everything I do. I have no trouble with either my long hair nor my glasses. They snap into the charging case and seem to solve the failure to charge problem.Sound and software featuresThey paired with my Apple devices flawlessly. The ear fit test was easy and helpful. Right out of the box, the sound was much like the Powerbeats. But running the quick ear scan for the adaptive eq and enabling spatial audio, set to fixed, made a huge difference. Highs sparkle, mids are clear and well separated, and it really gives a sense of soundstage that is hard to describe. Definitely keeping these.Sound CancellationI really don't have anything to compare the degree of sound cancellation to. The Powerbeats didn't have any, and my last attempt was with the original implementation by Bose, which really did not work for me. I heard a distinct buzz or hiss that degraded sound quality and I felt a headache-inducing pressure, so I stopped buying the tech. Since that was literally decades ago, I decided to try out the new tech. So, the caveats to this section are that I cannot compare them to the AirPods Pro 2 (supposedly better than the Beats) or the AirPods Pro 1 (supposedly not as good). Also, I live in a cabin in the woods and don't have a lot of noise to cancel. My overall impression was that the effect of the noise cancellation was - subtle. I ran two tests. First, I used the buds with some kind of power tool being used on a construction site about 100 yards away. It was loud enough to be annoying with the buds out. Just putting them in my ears accomplished some passive isolation. As you would expect, turning on ANC made the volume lower, and Transparency made the volume louder. With no music playing, I could hear the noise in all three modes. Playing music, the noise completely disappeared. The second test was in my living room with the tv on. The results were the same. I am satisfied with the sound cancellation on these buds. They don't hiss or buzz, they don't produce a sensation of pressure, and they remain comfortable after a few hours of use. I think whether the sound cancellation is good enough for you will depend on what sound you are trying to cancel and what other products you have tried.The one glaring flaw that prevented my giving them 5 stars is the way volume control works. First, the physical buttons can be used for EITHER volume control or changing noise cancellation modes. Whichever one is not chosen can be controlled by the phone or by Siri. I think the whole purpose of these bud is for activities where you don't want to be carrying/looking at your phone. Siri works (sometimes) but there is an annoying lag. Also, using Siri to move volume up and down is slow, hard to predict the amount of change, and requires spoken commands, often repeated ones. Not ideal in many situations. Also, if you set the button to control volume, they are ""fiddley"". There is a lag before adjustment begins, and it is then hard to stop it where you want it. Seriously, the one control I most use when listening to music is volume control. It needs to be done right. The Beats Fit Pro implementation is a big step down from the physical controls on the Powerbeats.Overall, I like these buds and am going to keep them. Should you buy them? Speculation is that the second generation is coming late 2023 or early 2024. Speculation is that they will get the superior sound cancellation currently available on the AirPods Pro 2. Will they get the upgraded ""Find My"" capability? Will they finally fix the volume control issue? No one knows. So, as always with tech, the decision to buy or wait depends on what you have now, how important potential improvements are to you, and how confident you are with feature and timing predictions.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2023",AHOLKA6LYBP76IOHUUWJZRBNZRQA,1,28,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 4, 2023",2023-08-04,2023-08,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

Gulley,5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but when I find a product that not only does what it is supposed to do, but exceeds what is advertised, I must spred the word.I have tried many ear buds, both wired and wireless with little satisfaction. I am hard of hearing and I miss many of the high notes, even with my hearing aids on. The Beats Fit Pro are not hearing aids, but I am hearing highs that I haven't herd in years. My hearing aids cost me more than $3000. and listening to music with the beats is much clearer than my expensive aids. The highs are crisp and clear and base i nearly perfect. I havent been this impressed with a product in years. If you are an Apple user, then you are in for an added bonus as the Beats Fit Pro takes advantage of many of Iphone, Ipad, and Mac features. My only wish is that the battery would last a little longer as I like to sleep wearing them. The 7 hours isn't quite long enough for all night use, but close enough. Some wirless buds will last longer on a single charge, but at the expense of sound quality. The price currently is just slightly higher than many of the off brand buds and is worth every penny. The Beats Fit Pro are great, best purchase I have made on line in a very long time.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFBTTTNRF6WHC4KLRHJEG7XXMTFA,1,7,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 19, 2024",2024-06-19,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

I wanted something wireless so I wouldn‚Äôt run into the problem I experience with my Bose earbuds - Apple changed the port again. So, I bought Beats since they had such good reviews. For the first couple of days I thought I was going to have to return them due to very muted sound through the right one. Plus, I have small ears and the darned thing hurt after just a few minutes. After reading a few articles, I did a hard reset but to no avail. It was finally on the 3rd reset and turning my iPhone off completely for a bit before repairing the Beats that I had success. As far as the fit, if you play around enough you‚Äôll find an acceptable placement while still getting a good seal. But, patience and persistence paid off.

RKDKPF4JF91SL,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Best Pair Of Wireless Buds I've Bought,BZS,4.0,"I've had my eyes on these, the original Bose Quiet Comforts, and the 2nd generation of the Airpods Pro. I was able to get them on sale for a good deal on Amazon, so I thought I'd take a chance on them. Worst comes to worst I just return them. So here is my honest review after an afternoon of using them...As a preface: I am a longtime owner of Powerbeats Pro (the ones that fit around your ear). While I loved the battery life, the design of the charging case leads to a ton of charging issues and thus ability to use them. The headphones get loose when you're not using them if you don't precisely place them right, so when you go to use them they may not have a charge. I never liked the loop around your ears headphones either as it would give the back of my ear a rash/irritate my skin for some reason (may just be me, so keep that in mind).1. I've seen a lot of people saying the wing tip that helps secure the bud in your ears irritates theirs. This was a major concern for me when I first opened them. I spent a couple of hours wearing them, and even while working out, I felt no discomfort. Based on some other reviews, I'd say the shape/what your ear looks like matters. Mine feel fine though, so no complaints there. I work out a ton, so I'll be curious to see how they hold up.2. I noticed a ton of ANC debates in reviews for these, but there are debates regarding the ANC capabilities of other headphones (ex. Bose Quiet Comforts, which Bose is deemed the king of ANC). It is all relative, in my opinion. I used to have a pair of Airpod pros, and in my opinion, the ANC is just as good. I think it depends on what you can reference, but I have 0 complaints in the ANC on the Beats Fit Pro.3. An area I do agree with others on is the case... This thing is TINY. Way more than I thought, which is nice given you can really take them anywhere. The problem is the material, like others point out. It feels like plastic and is so slippery it feels like you could easily let it slip out of your hands. So be careful there I'd say.4. As Beats, ahem Apple, transition from USB to USB-C, a major let down is the fact you HAVE to be able to charge the Beats Fit Pro with a USB-C charger block, a Macbook, etc. So if you are thinking about getting these, buy one in advance or when you purchase them. They case charges super fast though, which is nice.5. I really like the look of these ear buds when compared to others. I never liked the look of Airpods, and the Bose Quiet comforts have always looked a little weird. Low profile and just overall look nice.Overall review: I'm pretty satisfied with the Beats Fit Pro. The fact I got them on sale from $200 to $150 is an absolute bonus as well. The ANC is good (does what I need/want), 6 hours of charge, with 15 minute fast charging if you for some reason need it, and overall look makes me pretty happy. I'll be curious to see how I feel overtime of course, but as of right now, I'd recommend them if you're looking for some ear buds. I'd say keep in mind how the winged tip has irritated other's ears as that may depend on your overall shape of your ear.Overall grade: B+ (Only because of the case material, how easy it is to drop it, and the mandatory USB-C charging)Edit: Be careful buying from Amazon. Your headphones can clearly not be new despite saying you are buying them new. My warranty, when I bought them in the beginning of May, only runs till the end of October 2023. If you buy any Apple product, I believe, you get a full year limited warranty. They look new, but you don't get them in the typical plastic wrap Apple headphones come in. What you get for buying them at a good price though, so assuming I have no issues, this should be okay. Still satisfied none the less!","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AFRATEP246MOENSBSXOOA3LA5GXA,1,62,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"May 5, 2023",2023-05-05,2023-05,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R3O9HACBPLU4S1,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Not without its flaws,J. Kerekes,4.0,"The ""spatial audio"" gimmick feature cannot be turned completely off and is awful. One has to keep their head in one rigid orientation to be able to hear the music at normal volume; if you turn your head to the right, the left audio channel gets quieter. Very distracting and stupid feature. You can turn it ""off"" but it still activates on some audio sources (like youtube videos) where it just becomes an annoyance.That aside, the fit is good, the batteries lasts a good while, and the case and earphones have survived two separate 2ft drops onto hard surfaces. The sound is good but a lil bass heavy. Phone calls are fine but the person you're talking to will hear a lot of environmental noise, like traffic and wind.Overall, these are a great choice if you have $180-200 burning a hole in your pocket; certainly better than the $30 wireless earbuds I've had in the past - but not in proportion to the price difference. However, if you'd be watching or listening to a lot of youtube videos with these, you should probably get something else.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AGCY7CTKNVITSE4O5PQO6CGWACXQ,1,3,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 5, 2024",2024-06-05,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

I‚Äôm very physically active and any time I start moving and sweating I‚Äôve had issues with earbuds falling out. These stayed put and the sound quality is fantastic. The plus about these is that they are push as opposed touch active. Most earbuds that you have to touch or tap to answer a call or pause music are way too sensitive. With these being push/press active, gives a little more control. They are higher in price but they are worth it based on the quality, and performance. I will say that I did wish the battery life was a little longer but that‚Äôs minor considering I can make it almost a whole shift before I have put them in the case to charge.

With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that ""perfect fit"" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2022",AHSA34L25CYRE4DF2VS5NFDW53SQ,1,436,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"October 24, 2022",2022-10-24,2022-10,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R39INML3B00LFW,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent earbuds,M.R,5.0,"Brought these a few months back as I lost my old JBL 510 headphones. I was initially going to replace them with air pod pros, but didn‚Äôt want to pay the price, and wanted something geared more towards active people. I found these and decided to try it since they were on sale. Right out of the box they were a very nice fit (I do change tips occasionally) and the sound was better than my 510s. Fast forward to now and they have been the best things I‚Äôve ever played audio out of. I‚Äôve seen people saying the case is a little flimsy, and I can see the point there. However, I‚Äôve dropped the case three times in the same day by accident (twice when getting in and out of a suburban and once in the house down the stairs) and it‚Äôs only got tiny dents to show for the concrete drops. The noise canceling works extremely well, wind does still get through but that‚Äôs not a big deal unless you‚Äôre going to be in a windy environment all the time. Overall 10/10 from me.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AECNPR5U2KHDYDCAWZAE4A3GRUDQ,1,6,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 5, 2024",2024-06-05,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

I thought I'd like these and wouldn't switch back to AirPods however I was incorrect. The speakers sound is starting to go in and out especially if I am on the phone or a conference call. These were great to connect to a work laptop but now, people can barely hear me speaking. Originally these were bought for the noise cancelling quality and color option but I'm not sure I got my moneys worth for one year of use. Having kids and dogs around was the main reason I bought them but again they started to deteriorate around the 1 year mark. The noise cancelling quality isn't up to par with the AirPod Pros since I can still hear the dogs barking.If you only want headphones to last one year then these are the headphones for you. I'd recommend them then.

I considered buying Apple branded wireless earbuds, but the Beats earbuds are just as tightly integrated as the Apple earbuds, and they offer superior features for a lower cost. They walk you through selecting the right size for the cups for your ears and they have a built-in audio check to ensure you're getting a good seal. I wear these on the treadmill; they are comfortable, the battery life is exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is amazing. I work out at a Planet Fatness, and they do a great job of blocking out noises and distractions around me, allowing me to focus on my run. They work pretty well for phone calls and they do have a feature where you can long-press and have it do several different things (by default, it will enable transparency--and it seems like you're not wearing earbuds at all).

R35LEDCWE9RBVL,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very disappointing for what Beats is supposed to be,Cecil Aragon,3.0,"I am very disappointed in these earbuds. The first problem is that the ANC is not as good as you would think. The second problem is the lack of good bass. I mean these are Beats. They cost sooo much compared to earbuds from lesser known brands, and so you would think that they would be the best quality, but they aren't.I am not a name brand person at all. However, the ONLY reason I bought these is because I was looking for earbuds that would not fall out of my ear like my others do. These are the ONLY ones that I could find that have a hook to keep them in my ear. So I broke down and bought them. Well, they do stay in my ear which is the one positive.Now on to the disappointing negatives.1) ANC - the active noise cancellation is there, but it isn't as strong as my other earbuds that were less than half the price of these Beats. I am using them at the gym, and they just don't cancel out as much noise as my others and I am super disappointed in that. I can still hear too much ambient noise.2) Bass - the bass on these is sorely lacking. Again, my less expensive earbuds have way better bass than these - the known name brand expensive earbuds. I literally stood there in my kitchen and traded the Beats back and forth in my ears with my less expensive ones and no matter how much I tried to have the Beats come out with greater bass, they just don't.So in the end, for me, these are mediocre quality earbuds for way too much. I don't know if we're allowed to mention other brands on here so I won't but I will say that the overall sound quality and the ANC on my cheaper earbuds is way better. Again, the one positive is that these don't fall out of my ears.

RFVMZ1TEOIUYS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Kim K Beats,KK,4.0,"The media could not be loaded. Ugh I never write reviews but going to just this once for the hell of it! Gave this a 4 out of 5 stars but in my words here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶Purchased these in replace of the newest AirPod Pros‚Ä¶ AirPods were constantly falling out my ears, hurting my little tiny ears, a(n)extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant time. 0 out of 10 do not recommend! Seriously. I think this is good decent product. You can say I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with my purchase. First off, love the color. Really adore that part. Purposely purchased the color because not only is it giving baddie.. it blends with my skin tone, damn near perfectly. So when I‚Äôm at work, or even if my hair is up, or just even out and about, people can‚Äôt even tell I have earbuds in. Very discreet and convenient for that reason. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been asked if they are hearing aids at work lol. They also do not fall out whatsoever. Like seriously. These babies ain‚Äôt going no where. Haven‚Äôt tried working out in them yet but I think it‚Äôll be fine even with sweating. Really great sound quality, features (ex. noise cancellation *chefs kiss*), and super comfortable. Love that you can adjust to whatever shape or size your ear is! Along with the buds being very flexible. Even hours after wearing they may start to get a little uncomfortable and you can fix and adjust them so you don‚Äôt have any issues. Audio is excellent and great phone call/FaceTime quality as well. No complaints with sound. When i‚Äôm on the phone people be hearing TOO much lol. The ONLY negative(s) I have to say are that honestly probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase them again not for sound or feature reasons but the overall quality for the price! Definitely way over priced but I get it because it is a Kim Kardashian promoted product.. but atleast make the material more attractive and sturdy in regards tothe quality. Case that the beats are stored in is very light weight .. like too light. It really feels and looks cheaply made. Like they should be $45 at THE Walmart Supercenter .. Love the flexibility of the buds themselves but dislike the overall quality of the case the earbuds are stored in. The case also charges the buds as well and lasts throughout my 12 hour shift with battery to listen and not having to charge them at any point during my shift. I‚Äôve really only seen it had them die a couple of times on me and that‚Äôs really my fault for forgetting to charge them lol. Really wished they could‚Äôve used a more sustainable and STURDY material. Otherwise, everything else checks out and I will say that these are wayyy better than AirPods (at least for me and my small ears) and for reference I have had each version of the AirPods. Very comfortable, can tune people and surroundings out so easily. Love that part. ANYWAYS thanks for reading! That‚Äôs the Tea‚ú®‚ú® hope you decide topurchase!! You may or may not regret it lol. I do not suggest for people with LARGER ears. xx","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AF5Y6SZCJXNTDXRECVDQLQHLCELQ,1,156,Color: DuneStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"May 5, 2023",2023-05-05,2023-05,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R223ZZV2VR18TP,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars By Far, One of the Best",LPB,5.0,"I have bought over time more than a few sets of ""in ear earbuds"" that were supposedly ""noise cancelling."" Let me tell ya, the cheap ones that advertise that function I have to believe are lying. In reality, it doesn't appear that cheaper buds have any such noise cancelling technology. You can generally determine this if there seems to be no method to actually turn off the alleged noise cancelling, i.e., you can't turn off what's not there in the first place. And there would certainly be a way to turn off noise cancelling if it existed because doing so would save so much power and extend the life of your buds by several hours. So remember folks, if you're buying some 40 dollar buds that supposedly have noise cancelling tech: think again. Additionally, some of the earbuds I've bought previously also had over-the-ear hooks, because the ones without that device invariably fell out of my ear. The problem with my ears is that even with the ear hooks/loops, they could come out of my ears and just dangle there. Really annoying. None of my prior ones were expensive, but I finally decided to pony up and buy something a little expensive that I'd hoped I would like and be more effective: the Beats Fit Pro. They don't use a hook over the ear, they have a smaller soft loop that hooks INSIDE your ear. Totally different concept, but for me it works! I have no idea how well it'll work for others, but for me it's a godsend. They are stable and have no tendency to fall out. I put sound muffs over them when I'm cutting the grass on an extremely loud mower so I can listen to tunes when cutting and they haven't fallen out yet. And importantly, there is real and functional noise cancelling technology in these things. It can be controlled either by a button on one of the buds or by your smartphone, and it actually works. But be aware, it's not super great! It really does work: honestly there is real noise cancelling happening. But I've yet to use a noise cancelling technology that was super-effective, and this is no different. But at least it's real and there and does do something. And finally, there's the sound: they sound very good, and offer a good bit more bass response than the other earbuds I've used. You're never going to find earbuds that sound as good as proper set of headphones, but these sound really good. I'd buy these again--right now--as well as recommend them. Great sound, great fit and haven't fallen out, noise cancelling that actually works. All pluses. All in all, they're pretty nice, at least so far. I'm not disappointed, but if I should change my mind, I'll revise this review. Lastly, I was hesitant to buy these because I wasn't sure of the in-ear hook, but it actually works for me. For others with differently shaped ears, who knows!","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AFE5B2OAXWLQ5QDQVYUGAW3TSXJQ,1,11,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"August 16, 2023",2023-08-16,2023-08,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
R18670RYHHDHN5,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars if you're a runner- YES YES YES.,G,5.0,"invested in this because i finally had the money for decent wireless earbuds, and i saw great, detailed reviews from runners like myself. i am SO GLAD i did!Pros- never, EVER am i worried about these bad boys falling out of my ear. and i run hard- first run I had with these was an 8 mile run, and i was catching 100ft inclines in wind...they were AMAZING! if you're on the go, a runner, whatever, and you want something that will stay, this is for you! as far as noise-cancellation, i used them at work and it turned my loud coworker into a blissful, dim whisper! don't even get me started on the sound quality, especially the spatial surround...first song i heard made me tear up. sooo much better than what i'd been using before (basic wired lightning apple earbuds- hardy and reliable for about a year, but good for $20). battery life is AMAZING! i listened for 8 straight hours at work and only went to charge them when i went home, just because i had to put them back in the case. the case itself charged the earbuds at least 6 times before hitting 20% and i wanted to charge it just in case i needed it the next day (i will say, they weren't all 0 to 100% charges, more like the earbuds were down to 20-60% before i put em away, so you be the judge.) still, WAYYYY better than generic bluetooth earbuds that are obnoxious and die all the time. the earbuds also can work INDEPENDENT of each other! this includes noise cancellation! (so if you have a noisy coworker like me who sits on one side of you, and only one earbud is charged... you get it!) color is also true to advertising! beautiful lilac purple shade. and for range- just today I was doing laundry and didn't realize I had left my phone in my locked apartment one floor up and two large, closed rooms over until i was in the middle of moving a load to the dryer! seriously, it is POWERFUL.cons - they can hurt your ears if you leave them in for hours at a time, where the hooks rest. but for the quality...honestly, after an hour or two straight, just take a break! for noise cancellation, on runs it can make you feel like you're hitting altitude in an airplane, but DO NOT use noise cancellation on runs anyway! you need to hear cars and other potential hazards around you! and i haven't had issues with it on a treadmill, so this really isn't necessarily a con. :) they don't support wireless charging! and it only comes with a usbc (or whatever it's called) charger, neither end is a USB and it does not include a wall plug! however those you can buy for dirt cheap at walmart or meijer, so fret not. i usually use the usc slot on my work computer to charge mine. like others have said, case does feel a little flimsy so i might get a hard shell for it just in case.TLDR: if you're a runner, or have a noisy coworker, or on the go and want great sound quality and battery life, GET THEM! They are so worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2023",AHQENTDGUTJVQX4XN56XBGJRMVEQ,1,113,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"March 13, 2023",2023-03-13,2023-03,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

All settings were easily accessible and well organized.As others have mentioned, the case feels very flimsy and pops open easily when dropped and had to look for one bud under the couch at one point. This isn‚Äôt too big of a deal if you get one of the zip up accessory cases.With all of the positives noted below, I really wanted these to be my new buds.

R157LGUAIEIW85,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but only good.,RW414,4.0,"2024-08-02: As We strive to hold Ourselves to the highest editorial standard an update is in order. These are very decent earbuds (with a surprisingly good battery) hampered by the implicit lie of the wing-things. Get them but don't expect the wing-things to last (or just get AirPods if you're in an iOS ecosystem). The 3.5 is accordingly raised to a full 4.2023-08-07: I am going to upgrade this to a 4 star (which is really a 3.5). They're decent buds and, while the wing-thing should be user-replaceable, it's a bit of a belt-and-suspenders thing (unless you're hanging upside-down or have the world's oiliest ears you should be fine even when they fall off, which they probably will). They're ok. Not sure there's a reason to go with them over current-gen AirPods.So I'm going to assume here that you're looking at these and going ""Oh hey, they're as iOS-integrative as AirPods but they also have a little wing-thing that holds them in: neat!"" because that was my thought process too.Let's dispense with the positive first: The earbuds are good if maybe not great at their core functionality (playing sound), the H1 chip makes pairing these with iOS really easy and it integrates with iOS well. The buds look good and they're fairly comfortable (I think my ears are pretty normal), The sound quality and battery life and noise cancellation were all good, certainly good enough to recommend. No physical volume controls so bear that in mind.Most negative reviews seem to focus on how the case is trash and it very much is: the surface is made from a slippery plastic (feels different from the plastic of the earbuds) and has a single hinge that doesn't feel very secure (it relies on the case magnet to stay closed), the case doesn't show up on FindMy (the buds do which is a nice feature). The case feels in a word ""cheap"" which is a problem at this price. It's actually strange how much the case feels like it belongs to an entirely different product!My issue isn't with the case though, it's with what I talked about above as being the reason I bought it, the product-defining feature: the little wing-thing that holds it to the ear. If you use these regularly but have to remove them often the wing *will* start to tear at the ""stem"" near the connection between it and the bud. That needn't have been a problem (or at least not a problem serious enough to not recommend it) if the wings were user-replaceable but they aren't. This is user-unfriendly design: if you have a multi-component device the failure of a non-core component which doesn't compromise the functionality of the core component should be removable and replaceable by the end user to maximize the service life of the device. Additionally, from an accessibility perspective removable wing-things would make the device usable by people with a broader range of ear sizes (in much the same way as eartips are variably sized).A $200 set of earbuds with a product-defining feature (the wing) shouldn't have that feature made from a material that doesn't have the tensile strength to accomplish the purpose of the feature (hold the bud to the ear) while tolerating the stress implied by that function and that of removal/insertion to the ear. The wing itself rests on the case surface with slight tension when the buds are clicked into the case and I suspect this doesn't do anything to improve their lifespan either. All of that might even be excusable if the design were modular enough to allow user replacement of the stressed components but they haven't done that.To sum up: Good earbuds, terrible case, interesting and product-defining wings but with poor materials choices and bad modularity. I don't have a suggestion as to what you should get but it shouldn't be this.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2022",AGRQVXOCVOHQKBIVNZBSGXQKLKFA,1,41,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"April 22, 2022",2022-04-22,2022-04,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R1YCY2ISTC6WYR,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Missing Features, but Solid Overall",Josh Rodine,4.0,"Generally speaking, I like these a lot. I use my earbuds almost exclusively for working out, so fit and comfort are very high on my list. I tend to have a hard time keeping earbuds in my ears, but the ""wings"" on these do a magnificent job of holding the earbuds in place. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is pretty good. Nice bass, and the treble isn't to tinny.Now for my complaints (and there are a few). My most recent buds were Sennheiser Momentum 3. They had a ton of features that the Beats Fit Pro lack. There's no customizable EQ. You can't control both volume and ANC/Transparency with the buttons on the buds (you can do both, but you have to choose whether the buds will control volume or the ANC/Transparency features--whichever you don't select has to be controlled through the device on which you're listening. This is really annoying for someone who is working out and not holding a phone. Ideally, I'd be able to control all of these features (i.e., playback start/stop/ff/rew, volume, and ANC) through the buttons on the buds (which was the case with the Sennheisers). That said, I really do appreciate that these have buttons rather than touch sensors (the later of which are far too easily activated by something simple like readjusting the position of the bud in the ear).","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AEQPR5N42OOFL3SDJNXZPSKBLQDA,1,0,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"March 26, 2024",2024-03-26,2024-03,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

I've paired them with my iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad Pro and Mac Studio with no issues.The only negatives would be that the included USB-C cable is very short but shouldn't really matter since most people have numerous longer cables. The bigger issues is with the case. It's extremely light weight and very slick so it could possibly be easy to drop. I just ordered a cheap silicon case for it which I really shouldn't have had to do if they designed it better in the first place. And it doesn't support wireless charging like the newer AirPod Pro cases if that's important to you.

R2I11IJ6RSPC38,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Fitness Headphones,Baer,5.0,"I purchased these to replace my Bose Soundsport Free headphones that stopped charging after 4 faithful years of use. I also own a pair of AirPods Pro headphones and felt like trying something in the Apple ecosystem after using various Bose headphones for my workouts over the last 10 years.The AirPods will not stay in my ears, and as a heavy sweater, I need earphones with the rubber wings to stop them sliding out. The Beats stay in perfectly fine and have a smaller profile than my Bose Soundsports did and the connectivity is seamless with my iPhone. If you have a set of AirPods these will be totally intuitive. The sound quality is identical to me and the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is a nice feature my old Bose headphones did not have, it does enough to drown out road noise and treadmill whirring. However, the ANC on these is not as good as AirPods and the sound quality while very close to AirPods, is perceptively lower (I really only notice if I go from listening to my AirPods to the Beats). The Beats are great if you need something for workouts and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, but if you‚Äôre just walking around town the AirPods Pro are better in almost every regard minus the staying in your ears. You can also adjust the volume on the Beats without using your phone, this is a massive plus if you are using them with Garmin fitness watches. I have music on my Garmin watch and nothing is worse than having to stop my run to cycle through my apps to turn my volume up or down (an obnoxious problem with AirPods).The only thing my old Bose headphones did better was durability for both the headphones and charging case. As other have pointed out the Beats case feels flimsy and cheap compared to an otherwise premium experience. I have dropped, sat on, and ran in rainstorms with my Bose headphones and never had any issues with water exposure. The portable Bose case feels much heavier and durable. While both the Beats and Bose headphones have the same IPX4 rating the Bose feel solid (this is just perception), however, the Bose were also bigger and heavier in my ears and I had ear fatigue after a few hours.If you need a quality sounding pair of fitness these are awesome. The market is saturated with wireless fitness earbuds and in most cases you won‚Äôt go wrong with name brands. However, these Beats checked the most boxes for me and as someone who is already well invested in the Apple ecosystem these were a no-brainer.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AGEMXONKY2DG7AL2BPUSIKRX2YOQ,1,28,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"January 24, 2023",2023-01-24,2023-01,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

So I got another pair that didn't have these problems except for the connectivity. It's still spotty, ANC is there but definitely not even as good as the 2nd Gen AirPod Pro's I replaced. I will say I appreciate the controls on these much more than the stalks on the AirPods, if you didn't grip those just right they wouldn't work anyway.Overall they're not bad, but they're overpriced even at a discounted sale of ~$170 considering that AirPods do still outperform these in so many little ways.

RAUKXC8YQKMSG,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very underwhelming,William R.,3.0,"First off, let me say, these are ok. I didn't have any issues or problems with them at all. The worked, paired easily, sounded good and stayed put pretty decent for my workout.Why the mid line review then?Well, I was just underwhelmed by the buds. For pushing almost $200, I expect something really high end, and something with some more adaptability, and these aren't that.First of all, the sound was good, but it didn't blow me away, and in that price point, I expected more. Second, the fit was ok, borderline not so good. I bought these for the gym. Now I am a big guy, and have big ears, probably bigger than most, but the ""wings"" on these buds were worthless for me, they were so small in my ear they provided absolutely no function what so ever. Again, for this price point, I would have thought these might come with some additional ""wings"" to adapt to each ear, that isn't the case. Last, I wasn't crazy about the ear tips, the selection wasn't great and they didn't provide a better seal or fit, in fact I used a pair of tips from another much cheaper brand that worked way better than what they provided with these.So in conclusion, the price point and what I got for the money wasn't enough for me to keep them. In fact, I bought another brand on here (off brand) and they have better sound, an app with an equalizer for custom sound, super stable and a fraction of the price so I kept those and returned the beats. I really wanted to love these, and don't mind paying for it if they are worth it, but these in my opinion were nowhere near worth the money spent.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AH35BYCKVPKTNTSSJ6OSI5DHMEKA,1,3,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"June 6, 2024",2024-06-06,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds
RJG9AE59EE4E8,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good fitness earbuds,Alex Rogers,4.0,"I got these earbuds for three reasons: I wanted something sweat-proof that would stay put on my finicky ears regardless of what kind of fitness training I'm doing, I wanted to have the same functionality as my Airpod pros, and I wanted to have a second pair of earbuds with a long-lasting battery for those end-to-end meetings days, where my Airpods just don't last long enough.This purchase pretty much fulfills my needs quite nicely: The Beats Fit Pro fit my ears snuggly, and so far I have not been able to shake them off at all; not even make the budge a bit; and yet, they're amazingly comfortable. They're very unobtrusive, even when lying down on my side and pressing my arm against my ear.The sound is very good, and while I have not really taxed the battery to the max yet, it does seem to last quite a long time. The specs say that each charge will last 6 hours, and I'm willing to believe it.The charger box is beautifully designed, and the earbuds fall into place with a very satisfying magnetic click, which ensures that the do not move from the box even if the box falls down with the lid open (great news for those who keep losing their earbuds!).The fact that I was able to get these for about $50 less than the Airpods Pro was a definite plus.As far as Apple compatibility is concerned, these work as advertised: instant recognition by all my Apple devices, smoothly switching from MacBook to iPhone to iPad; spatial sound, Find My - it all works.On the score-reduction side, I found it disappointing that the box does not charge wirelessly. Not a big deal, but it's just one of those little comfort details.The sound, while quite good, is definitely noticeably less crisp than with the Airpods. There seems to be a bit more emphasis on the bass, and a slight muffling of the sharp end that made feel less that thrilled with the output.Probably the most disappointing aspect is the active noise cancellation. It is there, it works, but it is far, far less effective than that provided by the Airpods Pro. I haven't had the opportunity to test them in something like an airplane yet, but just walking around the house and neighborhood, I can clearly hear a lot of noises that are almost completely drowned by the Airpods. This even after trying the different silicone pad sizes and ensuring that the noise cancellation test indicated a ""perfect"" seal.I would, therefore, not recommend these for demanding audiophiles, or those seeking a deep isolation experience. But for the purpose I got them, as good, reliable, comfortable fitness earbuds, they're perfect.","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2022",AFSHXPEFJDVHSOB2C4FVKKIWKCFA,1,38,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 26, 2022",2022-12-26,2022-12,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R2QSTU7T2KL6P2,B09JL41N9C,2.0 out of 5 stars Hissing in microphone plus charging failure,R. Wellmore,2.0,"EXPANDED REVIEWI wrote my original review (3 stars) a few weeks ago and now I'm expanding it due to recent problems and decreasing the star rating to 2 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEWThese are my first noise-canceling (NC) earphones. I'm taking a trip involving very small airplanes so baggage weight is important. I wondered whether these NC earphones could replace my Bose NC headphones. No. I'm sure it's not a fair comparison but on a scale of 0 to 10 where my headphones merit a 9, these earphones get a 4. I tested in the bathroom with the (loud) fan running. It's curious that when I turn off NC, the noise is louder than with no earphones in at all! The fan noise is somehow getting amplified through the earphones. But the NC issue is not as bad as the microphone hissing. I recorded myself on Zoom and consider these earphones unusable for that. There is a loud hiss accompanying my voice. I tried turning NC off to see if that had anything to do with it, but the hiss was still there. I sure wouldn't want to hear that, so I won't subject my friends to it. I'll stick with my Powerbeats Pro earphones for use with Zoom. So what are these Beats Fit Pro earphones good for? Listening to music. And with the modicum of NC they do provide, I bet they'll be good on bike rides. Not too much NC so you can still hear the traffic but they take the noise edge off so you can hear the music well without jacking the volume up. Plus, with my Powerbeats Pro, I'd have to unfasten my helmet strap in order to get them on. With the Beats Fit Pro, I won't have to do that; I can just stick them in. Also, Duolingo doesn't mind the microphone hiss, so I can use them for that and the modicum of NC is nice when my housemates are being noisy. (The microphone on my Bose headphones is so bad, it's unusable.) Overall, I'm ok with this purchase. I'll still bring the Bose on my trip, but these earphones will be preferred for some things I do.ADDENDUMI'm writing this a few weeks after the original review. A few days ago, I noticed that the right earbud went dead and would not charge. I thought it couldn't be a seating problem the way there is with Powerbeats earphones because these Beats Fit Pro earphones snap into the case so assertively thanks to the magnets. But I pressed on the right earbud anyway and nope, no place to go. And things got worse. When I opened the case beside my iPad, there was no indication at all, no charge status, nothing, like the iPad wasn't picking up any Bluetooth signal at all even though the case had been plugged into power all night. So I pressed the button to go into pairing mode. After a few seconds, the iPad detected the case. Right earbud 0% charge. So I plugged the case in yet again, starting to suspect that it was the case that was malfunctioning, not the earbud. A few hours later, the right earbud was up to 100%. Pressing the pairing button had somehow gotten the charging circuitry back on track. I used the earphones a lot, always noting the charge level on both as I put them away in addition to when I open the case to use them. Then yesterday I had a situation where I opened the case near the iPad, the detection dialog appeared showing the case was charged to 100% and the earbuds were charged to 100%. Then I pulled the right earbud out. When you do that, the dialog usually shows the charge status of each earbud. But in this case, it didn't. It continued to show one earbud icon at 100%, as if there had only ever been the left earbud in the case, as if the right earbud had never been there. With the dialog still showing, I returned the right earbud to the case. It snapped in because of the magnet. No change to the dialog. I then pressed on the earbud and tried to wiggle it a little. I didn't feel anything move but nevertheless, when I pulled the right earbud out again, the dialog finally showed two earbuds with the left at 100% and the right at 74% which is what I had put it away at the day before. So there's definitely something wonky about the case. I'm glad I have Applecare but the geek in me wants to continue characterizing the problem. I wonder how widespread this is.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2022",AGCTPXL5366EV36I2LCUBBEAUVFA,1,7,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"December 25, 2022",2022-12-25,2022-12,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R2028I5PGDAG3L,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars All the benefits of AirPod pros but a more secure fit!,jdwilson,5.0,"I have had Airpods, Airpod Pros, Tozo NC2's, and several other sets of Bluetooth wireless headphones. Each one has different features that I really like and some features that are missing.Pros:The Beats Fit Pros really excel in many areas. They absolutely rival the sound of the last set of Airpod Pros I had. I honestly cannot think of one time that I've thought, ""These are good, but they aren't Airpod Pros."" The sound quality is excellent and the tap button on each ear make for really easy to use controls. I like having a tactile button that you can feel when it is pressed as opposed to some other versions that just use touch.The BEST feature of these, however, is the fit. They are really comfortable. So much so, that there are times that I forget I'm wearing them. And they do not fall out. I use them a lot (that's probably why they look a little dirty in the picture). I keep the case in my pocket all day while I'm at work. I use them to answer phone calls and I've found them to be very natural sounding. I also excercise in them regularly.One other tidbit...the noise cancelling is really good. I coach a volleyball team, and some of the match environments we go to are EXTREMELY loud. I wear these in NC mode, and it quiets everything done.Cons:Battery life. While I don't kill them super fast, if you wanted to leave home and wear them and use them all day...well, that's not going to happen. I've found that I put them in at 100% and go for a 1 hour run listening to podcasts or music and they are at about 80%. Constant use of music/phone calls, you might get a continuous 6 hours. However, the case does charge very quickly.The case. I don't love the feel of the case. It's really slick. It goes in and out of your pants pocket really easily, but it will also slip out of your hands easily as well. It doesn't feel badly, it's just a little slick for me. The other thing I don't love about the case is that I wish you had an idea of how much charge the case has without using your phone. I know the case and Beats Fit Pro vitals are meant to be read on the phone screen, but it would be nice to not have to sometimes.All in all, for $50+ savings on the Airpod Pros (sometimes even more than that) I would definitely buy again.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2023",AGMFL27BEGD3ZLU6TSMUELDKNHGA,1,66,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"April 5, 2023",2023-04-05,2023-04,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R2X41UR9XA2T0S,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound great, stay put, but really not for those with small ears",BrCottle,4.0,"My past pair of airpods pro got totally destroyed in the wash, so I wanted to take a chance and see if there were any earbuds better than them for me. Heard a lot of good things about this pair, several review outlets (including the New York Times) include the beats fit pro (BFP) as essentially the best possible earbuds you can get right now. I honestly can see what they mean, they have a lot going for them, but one fatal flaw (in my case) that made me end up returning them. Even though they are such small earbuds, they are just too big for my ears! I consider myself an audiophile, I have quite small ears, and I use headphones for easily 5-7 hours a day whether that is on calls or listening to music/voice. I'm very picky about the tech I use, so whenever I stick with something it really has to be good.Here's what I've found in general for the things that were important to me, in particular in comparison to the AirPods Pro since that is what I was comparing them against ultimately:- The audio quality is *slightly* better. I found there is more separation in the instruments for both classical and pop-esque/modern music. There is a very appreciated increase in ""oomph"" and resonance from the bass with these headphones that I often found myself missing with the airpods pro. The BFP have that going for them.- The wing tips and overall design really helps them stay put. Because of my small ears, if I want to/try to I can usually wiggle earbugs out of my ears just by opening my mouth or chewing, but these really stayed put.- Unfortunately, they really are too big for my small ears. I've included a picture of the smallest earbud size on the BFP and the airpods pro for comparison, and there really is (to me) a significant difference. The BFP would become uncomfortable after just 10-20 minutes, then I would get used to it, then once I took them out my ears would start hurting again. Seems like they essentially made my ears numb to the pressure, but afterward it was quite uncomfortable.- Just for comparisons sake, the smallest airpods pro tip fits *perfectly* in my ears, and doesn't put any undue pressure anywhere. I can use them easily for working out, etc. This, along with the apparent higher call quality from the AirPods Pro made me stick with them again. If the beats fit more comfortably, I would have gone with them because I like that they are newer, the auto on-off worked better, longer battery life, and more satisfying audio quality.- a couple other notes: the ANC of the BFP is noticably worse than the airpods pro for me, but the really high quality transparency modes are about the same between the two.Those are my thoughts, returned these and went with AirPods Pro, since they still work *very* well, are very comfortable, and fit my particular needs quite nicely.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2022",AHTMKEIAPNLS6AMOSG64JNBR4EUQ,1,93,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,"July 12, 2022",2022-07-12,2022-07,Sony,Sony Portable Wireless Earbuds

R3K1BA2E69BDN9,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound Quality and ANC out of my 15 pairs of earbuds,Resume Ryan,5.0,"I have a wireless earbud problem. From my first set 8 years ago, on through my inability to resist fantastic Woot deals, and including two other pairs of JBL buds, I have accumulated 15 sets. These JBL Live Pro blow EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY. I have the JBL Vibe 200TWS which are a great entry-set but lack premium build materials, have a narrower dynamic range, and aren't compatible with the JBL app. I also have JBL Tune 230NC TWS which I picked up on a great deal on Prime Day and have an impressively rich sound and work with the app so I can customize my own EQ - my only quibbles are that they don't get quite as loud as I want for music and the ANC is mediocre. Enter the Live Pro; game: changed.These have the most impressive dynamic range I have heard in any ear bud (I also have Galaxy Buds 2, Asus ROG buds, and bought [and returned] Raycon Everyday buds). They bring great, rich bass, warm midtones, and balanced high end sounds. The ANC is freakishly good. When I have a good seal, the only thing I can hear is my own inhalation (which sounds oddly like the opening of Every Rose Has its Thorn) and the build materials have a much more premium feel to them - metallic posts, great tips, an elliptical design which fits comfortably and tightly. The battery life is great, the app interface is useful for testing the dynamics of your ear and optimizing sound delivery, and the tap gestures seem to be able to differentiate when I am gesturing versus adjusting fit. The only minor quarrel I have is that over the course of about 20 hours of listening, I have had 4 or 5 brief bluetooth glitches on Spotify. Nothing major, less than 2 seconds each, but a minor annoyance.All that said, these are my new daily go-tos and I will be spreading the good word far and wide.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AG3PKN6CDPV3AANM4OUQJYACLOKQ,1,35,Color: Black,"February 12, 2024",2024-02-12,2024-02,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
R1TO6XEYG3PL57,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Such An Amazing Product from JBL!!!,Sherry G McKinney,5.0,"I am an avid music fan and appreciate good sound. I wear buds at work 5 days a week for around 8 hours a day. I was pleased with my Beats Studio Buds, they are great, but battery really sucks. I started searching for a replacement with the same quality and much better battery life when I came across these. I‚Äôm not the type of person that will drop $250 on the new AirPods Pro 2nd gen because they‚Äôre supposedly the best and are super popular. I believe in ‚Äúbang for your buck‚Äù and audiophile like sound without having to shell out too much. Now it takes a lot to impress me, I‚Äôm a dj and know what premium audio is. JBL makes great stuff and have been around for 75 years. I compared all the features and they are so similar to the AirPods Pro. Got them @ a steal of $99.99 on sale, normally $149.99! Lemme say everything about these buds is fantastic! The fit/feel is tight and comfortable and comes without fear of them falling out. The sexy blue finish is so appealing and total ‚Äúeye candy.‚Äù The battery is wonderful @ 40 hours total including case with 10 hours in the buds alone! JBL is a brand that‚Äôs well known for their innovation and reliability as these earbuds are a clear representation of that. They are built solid, have terrific call quality and the noise cancellation is the best I‚Äôve ever heard in a pair of earbuds. The best part about the Live Pro 2‚Äôs is of course the stellar sound that features powerful rich, hard-hitting, and deep bass notes combined with perfectly balanced crystal-clear highs + mids. The 11 mm drivers really shine and the detail comes to life without distortion, for the frequencies don‚Äôt overpower each other. You can pump up the volume and not worry about blowing them. I tried out the app EQ but my problem is that you can only use it with both buds in as well as not having enough presets. I listen to primarily EDM and have to customize to my liking because I prefer a lot of bass, ‚Äúwarm‚Äù mids, and ‚Äúcrispy‚Äù highs. I don‚Äôt prefer to listen to music flat. It would be nice to have the EDM presets such as ‚Äúdance‚Äù and ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù available. I found that the ‚Äújazz‚Äù setting is pretty good. Other than that these absolutely rock and can go head to head with the AirPods Pro 2nd gen. They contain the exact same size of drivers. Maybe they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt as good, but indefinitely very close.

R3MR7L2QDVM3HC,B09V9P5Q6W,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall Very Good,T. Towe,4.0,"EDIT: I've been using these for about 2 weeks now, 2-5 hours every weekday at work, primarily for cell phone call, calls on the Microsoft Teams app on my phone, and Teams on my PC (with a couple of Zoom calls thrown in). - The multipoint is flawless. I have yet to actually need to force the earbuds to switch devices (I think you do this with a single tap followed immediately by a long press on the right earbud, but I'm not sure), they just do it automatically. I can actually be on a Teams call on my PC, transfer the call to the Teams app on my phone, and the earbuds just switch: perfect. - When I'm on a call (two-way communication through the earbuds, not just one-way music) they use about 40% of the battery in 2 hours. This disappoints me a little, but reality is I'm never on the earbuds more than 3 hours straight, and they charge up so quickly when I put them in the case that it's just not an issue.ORIGINAL: I bought these specifically for office work: I wanted a pair of earbuds with multipoint (Teams and Zoom on a Windows PC and an Android phone, as well as phone calls), long battery life, good microphones, and comfortable. These fit the bill. - Clear and understandable microphone - Very good battery life: I've seen about 10% battery usage from 1hr of music playback at about 40% volume with ANC on, and about 15% from about 1hr on a phone call. They are also supposed to get 4 hours of playback from just 15 minutes of charging (pretty tough to test this), so if I run the earbud batteries low I can power them up again fast enough to be useful. - So far pretty seamless switching between my phone and laptop, but I've mostly left them in the case until I need them, so I haven't done enough testing of this feature - Very light and comfortable with minimal protrusion into my ear canal. At this point, I've worn them for up to about 3 hours straight with no issues. - The case is pretty small, very portable and pocketable.If you're primary usage is multiple hours of calls per day from 2 devices, just get these, you'll be pretty happy.For more general use: - Crystal clear sound, but little bass out-of-the-box. However, the equalizer in the JBL app is excellent: it starts with 10 bands (+/-6db) and lets you add, subtract and move bands around in frequency seeming however you want. And again, crystal clear: you can pump the bass significantly and it sounds very good. This is the best equalizer (both impact on sound quality and flexibility) of any bluetooth earbud app I have used. - The ANC is very good, if you get a very good seal with the eartips. - Ambient mode is good, but I never feel like ambient mode is good enough to carry on a normal conversation while I'm wearing both earbuds. - ""Hear-through"" mode drops the volume as well as turning on some version of the ambient mode; doesn't do much for me. - Auto-play/pause of the music when you remove an earbud from your ear and replace it in your ear is not so robust, it works maybe 75% of the time: sometimes it doesn't pause the music when I pull an earbud out of my ear, sometimes it doesn't restart the music when I reinsert the earbud. - These earbuds don't quite go deep enough in my ear canals to provide the very good ANC, or a very secure fit, and if I listen to music I will need to adjust them periodically (multiple times per hour) to keep the tips really ""aimed"" into my ear canals and preserve the audio quality. For my particular ears, I need 1-2mm deeper protrusion; if a little shallower works well for you, you might fall in love with the audio quality and ANC.Why these aren't 5 star for me: - Fundamentally, the not-quite deep enough fit, so they don't seal well enough and not move for extended periods. This is the big thing for me, but there are a few other nits. - In the app, you need to add ANC to the touch controls (so you can cycle through ANC, Ambient mode, and Hear-Through mode). The earbuds or the app sometimes seem to forget this has been enabled and then I don't have ANC, until I go back into the app and re-enable it. I haven't seen any consistency on this yet. - Touch controls are limited: three groups of controls are available (volume control, playback control, or ANC/Ambient control) and you can choose in the app to put one group of controls on each earbud, so you have to choose which group of controls you will not have.If these fit my ears just a little better, they would be my #1 pair of earbuds, period; without that, they are #1 for calls. My Sony WF-C500s are still #1 for extended music sessions, and these JBLs are kind of tied with my Wyze Buds Pros for #1 for music with ANC.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2022",AE2WC2L45TPTKJGSLRQWCDLYEDJQ,1,91,Color: Black,"December 4, 2022",2022-12-04,2022-12,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2023",AE3Z2WDE3L4HJQATPE3GWDNQGF3A,1,123,Color: Black,"July 19, 2023",2023-07-19,2023-07,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
RD6R0SI64RNZS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic earbuds and value,waloody88,5.0,"I wanted to give these a score of 4.5, but that wasn't an option. I liked everything except the controls. I bought it at $100, but it is a good value even for $150I will compare this to Edifier TWS1 Pro and CA Melomania 1+ which I used with Google pixel 4a 5GSetup:Live 2 pro is the best. It supports Google fast pair unlike the other 2. Melomania supports 5.0 Bluetooth with a right earbud as main so you can initiate a connection with either both side or right, but not left alone. You can switch easily from right only connection to left only, but not left to right. Edifier TWS1 Pro had bt 5.2 with aptx adaptive so it was easy to switch and connect.App support: melomania as a decent app, but no as good as JBL's. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no app support.Connection quality: the JBL has a reliable connection with a few cuts that last 2 seconds( I did most of my testing on music mode). It didn't have aptx so I used AAC. AAC had a smoother sound with wider soundstage. SBC had harsher sound that felt compressed. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no cuts at at all thanks to aptx adaptive. Melomania had ACC and standard Aptx and BT 5.0 unlike BT 5.2 on the other two. It had many connections issues and cuts. It tends to restart when a connection is lost while playing music and you end up hearing a startup voice prompt and the volume resets to %50. Very irritating.Battery life: that all features about 10hr + 30hr battery life in theory, but only JBL can come close to these numbers. The TWS1 Pro doesn't always attach properly to the case to charge and remain connected draining battery when that happens. Melomania is even worse because on top of this it an earbuds can connect to your phone sometimes even while charging so it had the worst battery life. I didn't like the high performance mode of Melomania because it sounded worse and drained more battery. I used the regular mode.Wireless charging: only JBL has it but I don't have a charging pad to try itANC and Transparency modes: only JBL has it and the are both good but not the best in class.Case: TWS1 Pro has the thickest case. JBL's case is slightly smaller. Melomania had the smallest case. TWS1 Pro had only one LED light to indicate battery level of the case. Melomania had 5 LEDs for the case. Jbl had 3 leds for the case and 2 leds for ear earbud (7 leds in the case). That is so cool.Earbuds: TWS1 pro has bulky earbuds, but the touch area was not flat and it made touch controls easy to miss despite the responsive touch response. JBL has responsive touch controls, but the small surface area of the touch controls makes using touch controls a nightmare. Melomania had small earbuds that had responsive physical buttons.Comfort: all 3 were comfortable for me.Volume: Edifier TWS1 Pro had the lowest volume followed by Melomania. All of them were loud. JBL wasn't far behind Melomania.Sound quality: melomania had some weird magic. It sounded the best. It had great tuning and probably the best driver response time. It was warmer in a nice and natural way and it was the most detailed especially in bass. A V-shape tuning. However, it has the narrowist soundstage. JBL had a sound profile that is a bass boosted version of the Harman Target. It has a great bass. It was the smoothest sounding and it has the widest soundstage. TTWS1 lacked subbass and it had the harshest treble, but the least detailed. None of the 3 had an excellent mid but JBL had the mids of the 3 while Tws1 pro had the worst mids and weaks vocal details. In conclusion, the details of the driver carried the melomania, but JBL was the most balanced, smoothest and had the widest soundstage.Equalizer: TWS1 pro had no app. Melomania had a decent 5 band EQ but the frequencies were not properly labeled. JBL had the best EQ of all earbuds. It is a full featured EQ that labels the frequencies. I was able to make a custom EQ to make the sound even smoother even though JBL was already the most balanced of the 3.Autopause: only JBL has it.Sidetone: only JBL has that.Multipoint connection: only JBL has it. I could connect 2 devices at the same time (Android and windows), but I couldn't for some reason get both devices to seemlessly switch audio without completely disabling the other. That's weird and could be a bug.Earbuds controls: these is the area that made me want to deduct 0.5 star from my score for JBL. It has controls for everything, but you have to choose from 3 button presets that you can't manually edit for each earbud (playback, volume, ANC and Transparency). This is ridiculous. I can't have volume and playback on the same earbud in mono mode. Also I had to give up ANC preset completely because I set volume for left and playback on right. Tws1 had the best button preset for mono and stereo (despite not having ANC). Melomania had the same controls till they decided to remove volume control from mono mode in a firmware üòëLatency: tws1 pro had the lowest latency thanks to Aptx adaptive. Melomania had an average latency. JBL had the worst latency on music mode (default preset). On video mode it has a low latency that is comparable to Aptx adaptive in Tws1 pro. Normal mode didn't lower latency that much from music mode, but it made sound quality noticably worse than music mode.I had to return Melomania 1+ because of all the connection issues and it stopped working. I am still keeping the Edifier as a backup earbuds despite the not so great sound and charging issues. I love the JBl live pro 2 and it and I will update my review if anything change in it","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2022",AE32VCKTKJJP6FYGIIQ772TICNYA,1,88,Color: Black,"June 4, 2022",2022-06-04,2022-06,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
R30CUSW6PS3UPQ,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound which translates to great value,Parnone,5.0,"I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2023",AFA2QYDJOWIYGY6B6URKDUSOZ46Q,1,15,Color: Blue,"July 17, 2023",2023-07-17,2023-07,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

I literally purchased this model because of this feature. You may experience a slight latency in sound and it is a little annoying. If this annoys you, install the JBL app and switch your earbuds to VIDEO MODE. This mode is for video streamers. AUDIO MODE gives better sound quality but with a latency.

Great build and sound quality, easy to use and pretty complete app, very comfortable fit, great battery life, etc. The only issue I ran into, something that's been mentioned in several reviews, sound periodically and randomly cuts out (every 15-30 mins or so). It's as if they loose connection, get unsynced from the phone and then resynced back up with it a couple of seconds later. I don't wanna live with that so I'm gonna be sending them back, unfortunately. JBL you've got some fixing to do there.Edit: After resetting and then disabling a few settings it doesn't seem to happen nearly as frequently. So, I decided to keep them after all as I like pretty much everything about them - sound quality, comfort, design, etc.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AER4A7EK7OT5DDHWIUMDGWRME3RA,1,0,Color: Black,"July 24, 2024",2024-07-24,2024-07,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

Overall, I would not recommend these earbuds and I'll be looking to replace them soon. The main reason is simple: they do not stay in my ears.I cannot use them at the gym, while performing chores, or any physical activity. I've put up with them because I work at a desk for most of my day. Even so, while near motionless at my desk I am constantly adjusting them and pushing them back into my ears. I have tried all three insert sizes without luck.My girlfriend likes to sleep with her $40 noise cancelling earbuds in. I couldn't believe they stayed in her ear all night until I tried them on. Her cheap pink earbuds created such a seal that when I took them off it was like uncorking a bottle of wine.This may seem like a small issue, but it cascades into more issues. Noise cancelling is useless when the earbuds are constantly half falling out of your ears. I get more noise cancellation out of my wired earbuds because they actually form a seal in my ear. I am also unintentionally changing modes and pausing music by hitting the function buttons when pressing them back into place. Speaking of, there is a noticeable delay when switching modes. It's a small complaint, but still annoying enough that I usually take the earbuds out rather than switch modes when someone approaches me.My favorite thing about these is the battery life. With everything fully charged I can get through the better half of the work week while using them all day everyday. My recommendation would be purchase these if your largest concern is battery life as that comes in handy when traveling. Other than that I'm fairly certain you can get more for less by shopping elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AGMIVRBBWWBVEGJ43NYWUL4ZN56A,1,0,Color: Black,"June 4, 2024",2024-06-04,2024-06,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

Windows 11 changed the Bluetooth audio stack to support AAC and what that means is if there's no audio being played through the AirPods for about 5-10 seconds then it shuts off completely and takes another 5-10 seconds to turn back on (to save battery I heard). This just produces an initial audio start up lag. Think 1970's Kung-Fu lip-dubbing.Apple AirPods Pro 2:- Battery life is at 4 hours with ANC, 4.5 with ANC off (Each firmware update had made the ANC worst. Source: Reddit Posts)- Audio is neutral all around to please most consumers but its nothing exciting. Bass is definitely lacking.- Bluetooth 5.0, Apple H1, and lightning port connectionJBL Live Pro2:- Multi-connections (Maximum of 2 devices). I have my iPhone and Windows 10 laptop and they jump back and forth seamlessly.- If the earbuds have nothing in range to connect to them it auto defaults to ""Discovery Mode"". Pretty convenient.- 8-10 Hours playback easily (These are my EDCs and I have been using them for about 4 months now).- Touch controls! Yes! All your basic audio, ANC, and Alexa/Siri/Google. No volume but I'm completely fine with that for this price range.- ANC has AI auto-adjusting environment setting via app (App is on the GooglePlay and AppStore). It is slightly weaker than my AirPods. I tested by snapping my fingers on each earbud.- Earbuds do offer pause/play when removing them from your ears but its slightly slower vs. AirPods. The pause/play uses vibration more than the motion when I'm placing the earbuds back into your ears. Putting it in my pockets can cause audio to resume. ***Be aware of this***- Low profile LED lights on each earbud to give you light indicators of your battery, BT connectivity, and if audio is paused or playing.- App offers more audio fine tuning controls via app compared to AppleConclusion:It uses a USB-C charging case and its form factor is smaller than the AirPod Pros. It offers almost triple the battery life per session and double the features of the AirPod Pros. It does have a bit of an audio lag on my iPhone and laptops but so did my other non-Apple Bluetooth earbuds.Bonus: This review is completely subjective. This is the first audio product where I don't feel discomfort after my usual 8-10 hour sessions. It destroys my AirPods and Anker (latter having the worst fit and comfortability) in every way. Fitting is S+ tier and I don't have that constant worry or feeling that my earbuds will fall off.These review has been edited on 9/17/22 and are my currently daily drivers for the past 4 months for my WFH role and leisure.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2022",AFJYLFDBAE4YXQ7TPWMTPV6A32DQ,1,85,Color: Black,"May 27, 2022",2022-05-27,2022-05,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

R1T12HDAZWK4VG,B09V9P5Q6W,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound and noise cancelling, but too many technical issues",Pat Mullin,3.0,"I wanted to love these. I've had over-ear JBL headphones and the past and when it was time to replace my earbuds, felt confident that a JBL set would do the trick. While I love the sound and noise cancelling on these, I've just encountered too many problems along the way to justify what I spent on this set.PROS- Excellent, customizable sound. There's a JBL app (more on that in the CONS section) that allows you to adjust sound levels to suit your needs. I like extra bass and was able to fine-tune it to my liking.- Pretty good noise cancelling. Not perfect, but was definitely able to drown out the majority of stuff like gym noise, mower sounds, etc.- Long battery life and fast chargingCONS- The JBL app only detects my earbuds MAYBE 1 out of every 5-6 times I try to get into it. This has been a problem from the beginning and can be incredibly frustrating because the app is how you access the equalizer, improve noise cancellation, etc.- Mono mode is horribly hit and miss. Sometimes it works just putting one earbud in, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I have to put in BOTH earbuds and then put one back into the charging case. Sometimes it works for a while using just one earbud, and then the sound suddenly stops.- Reduced volume issues. I've only had these around 6-7 months and I've already noticed a pretty bad volume drop in the right earbud. I've cleaned them regularly and taken good care of them, but am already in a place where I'm probably going to have to find a new pair soon. I would have expected a pair of earbuds that costs north of $100 to last longer, especially since I've spent half that amount on earbuds in the past and gotten better life out of them.At this point I can't say I would recommend these, simply because there are bound to be options at a similar or lower price point that don't have the finicky quality issues that these seem to have.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AFJXHVKY65UIXCDRXVJV3LG5SO3A,1,5,Color: Blue,"April 18, 2024",2024-04-18,2024-04,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

R182V6ZTSGVSHT,B09V9P5Q6W,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent Enough, and Good Value Too!",Ian R. Baranek,4.0,"Replaced my Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro's with these and so far am pretty pleased.On the positive side: the battery life is a huge step up! Even with ANC toggled on, they pretty much last an entire shift at work with one charge. The charging case design is also a massive improvement; the buds snap well into place, the lid closes firmly and all around seems a lot more durable. Another huge point in their favor is stability. The round Soundcore buds would nearly fall out of my ears at the slightest jostling and required constant readjustment. These fit snugly the second I put them in and barely move from there, although I'll admit they do start to grate a bit after several hours of wearing them.As for my disappointments: I'd say the audio quality is a slight downgrade, potentially due to the lack of aptX support, but it's certainly serviceable. I'm also mildly annoyed with the app for lacking more robust customization in regards to the gesture controls. In my case, I'd prefer to map play/pause to the 2 second hold gesture and disable every other function, but unfortunately, that's not possible. Play/pause will always be mapped to single tap, and the 3 other gestures in the category cannot be individually disabled either. I've honestly gotten used to it and luckily the controls aren't quite as sensitive as I was worried they'd be, so not quite a deal breaker, just irritating. Another point about the app is there seems to be some latency when adjusting equalizer settings, like a noticeable delay before the sound is actually altered which struck me as odd. That being said, I did find the equalizer to be a bit more in-depth.Overall: so far, so good! I'll update with any future issues if need be.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023",AELDQSBTWWQWHFPQ2CLYQZRH723A,1,7,Color: Black,"September 25, 2023",2023-09-25,2023-09,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
R1PUBI0U34ANHS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars A deaf old man's review,Jon,5.0,"I grew up on 60s and 70s Rock. 20 years in the Air Force might be the cause of 70% loss of hearing in my left ear and about 30% in the right. Just layin' that out for the sake of relativity.Right now I'm sitting in Old Rocker Heaven, listening to Blondie's Heart of Glass (Vocal + Instrumental Remix). I can hear EVERYTHING, for the first time in a very long time.My first reaction to these earbuds, pulling up Don't Bring Me Down (ELO), was as close to Oh Em Gee as this dude ever gets. The first two measures of that classic rock tune blew me away, and then everything else. The breakdown at about 2:30 was SO CLEAR AND CRISP that I can't even describe it, except to say I could hear every rumble of the drums and bass, the whole of every note clear as a bell.I haven't tried the app yet (the earbuds paired to my old Android phone in a snap) but I've got Rocket Player with a 10-band equalizer on my phone. I don't need much else but I guess I'll try the app at some point, just to see if it really deserves the 4.4 google play rating or not. The app's low number of permissions is definitely a plus.""Heart of Glass"" finished while I was writing, now testing them with a 17-track Beach Boys mix. Haven't heard the Boys sound like this for at least 30 years.I've always liked JBL (they go way back) but they have surely outdone themselves with these earbuds. I might buy another pair sometime soon (in a different color, have blue right now) just to have a backup. I will NEVER want to be without these earbuds as long as I have a fair amount of hearing left.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AEQ7YFFIJ5CG5V4QDJFL23ECHS4Q,1,1,Color: Blue,"November 27, 2023",2023-11-27,2023-11,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
RREDY85TQQ1VC,B09V9P5Q6W,"5.0 out of 5 stars First impression: So far, the BEST true wireless earbuds I've tried!",Tony Snark,5.0,"For comparison, I have a pair of Beats Studio Buds and Sennheiser Momentum 2. Overall, these blow those out of the water! Especially considering the price. I guess I have sensitive nerves and a lot of earbuds get uncomfortable quickly due to the pressure. I find the Sennhesiers to be unbearable for more than an hour. The Beats buds are smaller and more comfortable but not quite as comfy as these. These sound better than the Beats. Tbh, I haven't used the Sennheisers in so long, I don't remmeber if they sound better, but these sound just fine, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. They certainly live up to my expectations from JBL and experience with their speakers over the years (I'm always satisfied).I bought these on impulse because they went on sale for half off, and at $75, I'm very happy with the purchase - they are absolutely worth it.What REALLY impresses me, is the app! Absolutely blows Beats' and Sennheiser's apps out of the water! JBL offers way more features and configurability than the competition! Smart and helpful features like ""Check my best fit"" that help you know for sure you have inserted the buds properly in your ears and power saving are nowhere to be found in those others' apps. They also give you the option to have voice feedback when you use the touch gestures (very nice because I always get confused what I'm doing with other earbuds with touch gestures) or turn them off if you are not a dummy like me, lol.Best of all, the voice awareness is THE BEST! On my Sennheisers, the feature is basically a lie. The Beats Buds let a bit more sound through, but I still could never hear people well enough over music, even at very low volume, so I'd still have to pause the music, making the feature useless.The JBL Headphones app lets you configure the awareness and you can set it pretty high. With these, I can hear someone perfectly over my music, even at a loud volume! I had lost hope in being able to do that, thinking I just had too much hearing loss to have a conversation over music or something. Finally, I know the feature just has to be implemented well like JBL has done.Lastly, I think the blue colorway looks very nice and the chromatic finish on the outer panel is sleek without looking cheap or cheesy.I highly recommend these earbuds, especially at their reduced price!","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AGC3AAQ4MVORRK3QWVIQ5ZM4LM4A,1,13,Color: Blue,"December 20, 2022",2022-12-20,2022-12,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker
R3SF3OX4RUEMTO,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Great earbuds for the workplace,F-man,5.0,"Sound quality: EXCELLENT when paired to a quality music source such as my Samsung Galaxy S23. The music I play through these drifts me away into a sea of bliss. These are not overly bassy so go with another if you like music that rumbles your ears. They have a good blend of high and low frequencies and have very good clarity.Comfort: These fit my ears just fine but the plastic housing part of the earbud presses against the inside of my ear canal so I can only listen to music for about an hour or two at a time. Because of this, I don't advise these to be used to fall asleep in.Hear through: My office (cubicle farm) has the occasional person coming up behind me and the occasional coworker looking to speak with me over the wall. This feature allows speech to come through while I listen to music and is in my opinion more important to have than noise cancellation. Generally, I can hear roughly 80% of the surroundings than if I were not to have these on.Noise cancellation: Very good. The music comes through very well when I transition from 'hear through' to NC. And the NC almost completely blocks out the commotion and white noise around me. It seems only 5-10% of the environmental sounds makes it into my ears which in my opinion is the sweet spot for how quiet I want things to be.In conclusion, I love these ear buds and I'm glad I picked them out over the 10s of others I researched prior to getting these.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024",AGTXXD4FCGMNTA3CQOYNNSDVEETQ,1,0,Color: Black,"January 7, 2024",2024-01-07,2024-01,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

RUDKVU0MOXBQZ,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic ear buds - UPDATED,#NAME?,5.0,"I've tried several pairs of lower cost ear buds and have experienced low cost results. After doing a lot of research I chose the JBL Live Pro. It has exceeded expectations. First off the fitment is very good for a non custom earpiece, ideally a size between medium and large would be a better fit for me as the large tips are just a teeny bit too big and it takes some adjusting to get a good seal for the noise cancelling. But once they are set all is good to go.The sound is awesome, very clear and the bass is deep and rumbles - something I have not had in previous earbuds. Phone conversations are clear on both my side and the callers. The bluetooth connects quickly to my phone without having to open any apps or make adjustments.I have yet to run out of power, even after using them all day.The noise cancelling is very good. I wore these while mowing the lawn in place of my usual over the ear headset. The mower went from a roar to sounding like a toy, making it very easy to listen to music or a podcast. The smart ambient feature also works very well.The App is intuitive and easy to configure.Overall I am very pleased and anticipate using these for a long time.UPDATE May 2024 - I lost one of the silicon ear tips and was surprised to find that JBL does not offer replacements and you have to go with an aftermarket brand - so I am taking back one star. Tips wear out or get lost, why JBL doesn't have replacements is a mystery, especially at this price point. I found a memory foam set that actually performs better than the OE tips in terms of comfort and staying in place.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023",AGWBEPMA7H33LZ5DJNH2TIYAEG7A,1,3,Color: Black,"November 10, 2023",2023-11-10,2023-11,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

USB-C is nice as well.Only (and relatively significant) issue is how the contacts are designed for the earbuds themselves. The pogo pins are extremely prone to sticking if you get your earbuds even a bit sweaty. Sometimes, the pins will completely refuse to connect to the earbud, and while they are smart enough to turn off after a few minutes of non-use, they will not charge at all in this case (and subsequently refuse to turn on on the next use until the pins are reset). You may need pliers to ease out the stuck pins in these situations. However, this can be remedied by quickly wiping off your earbuds' stems after a run, and by swabbing the contacts themselves with a q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol once in a while.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AF63WNMH3YSB6MP3K5CPNJUXVHKA,1,3,Color: Black,"October 24, 2023",2023-10-24,2023-10,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

I have had many a pair of wireless earbuds or headphones (at all price points) and these do exceed all of those in every category except one. The battery life is outstanding (all day podcast listener here) the charging case (super fast) and size of it is perfect (fits in my pocket) , they feel comfortable even while sleeping in them (I am a heavy user), and they come with multiple sizes of the rubber pieces that go in your ear and you won‚Äôt lose them because they stay on the buds when you aren‚Äôt wearing them unlike my last pair. The only downside I have found is they don‚Äôt stay in my ears really well. I have tried all sizes of the rubber pieces that fit in the ear and get my best fit with different sizes in each ear, but they still fall out pretty easily. They fall out mostly when I tilt my head forward or bend over, I have to be very careful while doing dishes or using the restroom (afraid water will ruin them). Sometimes just moving different facial muscles pushes one out causing me to have to readjust one frequently. As frustrating as it is having to reinsert or readjust them frequently I would still recommend these. Might not work great for runners or cross fitter‚Äôs but I am managing fine with hiking in the mountains and gardening for hours. I mostly listen to podcasts and watch YouTube with them so sound quality was second in importance to me over battery life. That being said, they sound great with music and phone calls too. I really Like the noise canceling feature, but don‚Äôt know why one needs the talk thru feature when you could just pause it, and I wish it had volume controls on the buds but not a big deal. A nice feature is when one slips out of position it automatically pauses my content and starts it back up when reinserted. This is my second JBL product, first was a shower speaker which I also love. I will definitely consider buying JBL products in the future.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2023",AHFBV4DPSXCFEDRQY2NGLDIOY2XQ,1,18,Color: Blue,"May 26, 2023",2023-05-26,2023-05,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

I'm actually very impressed easy to set up they sound pretty good. Comparing the Samsung buds to the JBL, the JBL keeps up pretty well the only downside seems to be that with the Samsung buds you can use all functions on both buds whereas on the JBL you have to choose different things for each side they don't particularly care for that idea. The other downside for the JBL is trying to adjust the volume from the buds when you're on a phone call, I don't believe you can whereas the Samsung buds you can.

The sound will come back on its own, but it's jarring for there to be no sound for a second or two when I'm listening to music or podcasts and disappointing since these are one of the more expensive sets of earbuds I have purchased. I also generally prefer the sound quality from my Anker ear buds, although I would note these do have a lot more options for customizing the sound experience.

R1YL0016Q3CYVE,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely 10/10,Jos√© Alejandro,5.0,"I will give my honest opinion about these headphones. Honestly, they seem to be the best earbuds I've had so far. Even though I've had Apple's AirPods since all my devices are Apple products, the only 'plus' they have is seamless synchronization with Apple devices. However, I find them quite expensive for what they offer. In contrast, these headphones have significantly better features and sound. The bass is incredible, and the noise cancellation is noteworthy. The touch controls work wonderfully, and the microphone is crystal clear.Initially, during the first week, I had issues with the fit as the app suggested my best 'fit' was MEDIUM. However, I felt the earbuds gradually loosening, so I decided to try SMALL, and now they fit perfectly. So, don't rely on the app 100%. Another rare issue is that sometimes, after 1 to 1.5 hours of listening, the music pauses for half a second and then resumes. After this, it doesn't happen again. I looked online, and a solution could be disabling the 'smart audio' option in the app. So far, it has worked for me, and hopefully, it won't happen again.As for the rest, the battery lasts more than a week. I rarely charge these headphones, and I use them for everything. These are $100 headphones that could easily be worth $180 - $200.","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2024",AE6I3PO2EPNEDH6CYEJVEPFFZKRQ,1,5,Color: Black,"January 6, 2024",2024-01-06,2024-01,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

R7X7RGP05G8O2,B09V9P5Q6W,"3.0 out of 5 stars Calls are really quiet, kinda sucks",Alex Founders,3.0,"I'm on the phone all day for work. I look for a few basic things in a headset or earbuds:- The ability to use either earbud for calls- The ability to mute my mic via the earbud- Sound quality both for me and for the person I'm talking toWith these, I can use either one, which is great. Mute requires me to press for 2 seconds, which isn't convenient when I need to mute quickly or unmute quickly to respond on a call. Sound quality for the people on the other end seems to be fine... However, sound quality on my end is garbage when I'm on a call. It's too quiet. It's fine when I play music and is plenty loud, but calls are really quiet.I called support and they told me to turn on ANC. That didn't help, and they didn't have a solution for me. Searching online, other people have had the same problem. They need to increase the volume range by about double to make this a decent product. It can probably be done in software. I asked the person to put in a feature request when I chatted with support, but I don't think she did it. JBL, please fix this with a software update. I'm on an android phone, and during a call the call volume is set to max (in fact, all of the different volumes are set to max). I tried changing EQ settings, and same problem. If I listen to music, it's fine. It's only on calls and meetings (slack, teams, etc).Also, a setting that would provide an immediate mic mute/unmute would be great. This isn't configurable in the app. Holding it down for 2 seconds is ridiculous.Edit: on android, if you click on the volume button on the side of the phone and the click the 3 dots under the volume slider that appears on the screen... Turn the call volume from max down to zero, release, and then turn back to max. This seems to have increased the call volume significantly. It's still quieter than all of my other headsets, but it's actually fairly usable now. The 2 second mute sucks though. I increased my rating from 2 stars to 3.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2023",AH6525CTYP6GUBX37UVDTSJGIZWQ,1,3,Color: Black,"July 18, 2023",2023-07-18,2023-07,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

However, lots of other earbuds do as well. If you were looking at these because of the extra features such as noise canceling and transparency mode (talk-through mode), then you will be happy with one, but really disappointed with the other. Call quality is good, with a clear pickup during phone calls. Noise canceling does its job, one of the better ones out there. However, if you want to have a conversation with someone as you're walking down the street, and don't want to remove your earbuds... There are better earbuds out there that do a better job for 1/3 the price (Tozo NC 2.) The ambient aware mode turned all the way up is a better option than the talk through mode, but still doesn't quite cut it. People talking at a normal volume are not brought into your ears at a high enough volume and clarity.

The sound quality is amazing with deep, smooth bass that doesn't overpower the mids or highs, just an overall great balance.Battery life is very long as advertised. I'll wear these for hours while working in the yard with plenty of battery to spare......and they're quite comfortable too.The noise cancelling is very good but not as great as the AirPod Pros (1st Gen). You'll still hear your lawn mower/hedge trimmer/leaf blower/vacuum to some extent but your music will still come through very clear (just turn up the volume! LOL). The Ambient Aware setting though is outstanding. There really isn't a noticeable dropoff in sound quality and the ambient sound coming in sounds very natural. This is very useful when driving with the fam......I can hear my music quite well while still being able to hear someone talking to me. Other brands I've used, like Galaxy Buds, Taotronics, Tozo NC2 (also a great product) , Bose and AirPod Pros (1st Gen), the sound passing through is overly hissy and the quality isn't that great and drowns out the music somewhat.The range is adequate, about average with all other brands, about 50-75 feet indoors (defending on obstructions) and 40 feet outside (with few obstructions). Nothing will beat the AirPod Pros' range, not for $100. Still, this is not a concern but it would make the product better if the range could be improved.Lastly, I love the customizability of the gestures for these JBL's. Of the aforementioned brands, these sound the best. You can set up each stick for a variety of functions, including volume up/down. Since I always have my device nearby I leave the left side to toggle between the different listening modes and the right stick to control music playback functions.I'm very satisfied with this product.

R23XZTW6W01PYN,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Fine addition to my collection,Raymond LaCour,5.0,"TLDR, 10/10 would recommend. I'm a big fan of JBL and this addition proves my faith is well placed. The earbuds are very intuitive to your inputs, whether taking one out or touches in general. The microphone quality is adequate and the two different modes of ambient aware and noise cancelling are a happy medium for the purposes they serve. The battery life is not massive in the unit itself, but it doesn't need to be, a week full of constant use between charges is all you need, and these meet that expectation, not to mention the 4-5 hours of playtime in the earbuds without a break is great. The JBL app is also well made, the tuning makes an actual difference in the output of sound. If you're shopping for a lot of different earbuds, I would go with these if you have an Android, idk about Apple because I don't use these on an Apple device.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2024",AHRKREM4X3X64FUXDM2XL57LBG3Q,1,0,Color: Black,"January 18, 2024",2024-01-18,2024-01,Sony,Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker

I thought it would be nice to have two earpieces to use for phone calls, that can also be used for listening to music. For phone calls, they're not as good as the Plantronics headset, but they're good enough. I drive 18-wheeler trucks and haven't had any issue with talking to people on the phone in a normal voice. What I'm not impressed with is the sound level. If there's a lot of noise in the background or you want to listen to your own music while someone else is playing the radio, these earbuds don't turn up the volume high enough so that you're only hearing your music. You can never really get that feeling like you're alone with your music unless you're in a quieter setting. So, for $100, it works. But, I wouldn't say I'm thrilled with these earbuds. The battery life seems good though.

I was going to use these for podcasts only but they are now my go to for music as well. Easy to control with taps and can quickly enable talk-through to switch to a conversation.

The audio quality was fine and the earbuds were comfortable, but I had these issues:-Connectivity: these were incredibly difficult to switch between devices. They automatically connected to my phone first, and if I wanted to switch to my laptop instead I had to turn off Bluetooth on my phone, then sit there and open and close the lid over and over for them to pair with my laptop. Very time consuming and frustrating.-AmbientAware mode: this is JBL‚Äôs version of transparency mode and it was very disappointing coming from AirPods. With my AirPods, transparency mode sounded like I wasn‚Äôt even wearing the headphones. With these, the environment noise was somehow even louder and definitely sounded like it was coming through a speaker. But yet, when I was speaking, my voice was extremely muffled. Even with adjusting the settings in the app, I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with it. I use my headphones for class and meetings so I am frequently using them to talk, and it was just very unsettling to me to not be able to hear my own voice clearly.I ended up returning them because of these issues.

I've been on the search for amazing sounding, noise cancelling earbuds for a few months now. I had the first Google Buds and even though they were a pain in the butt, the sound quality was beyond amazing on those. These JBL are the closest things I've found to that superb sound! I want to hear the bass, every hit on those drums, the backup singing, everything! I take these wherever I go now. On the JBL app, you can customize your Ambient Sound Control, gestures, voice assistant (mine is Google), etc. As for the fit, I know I have weird ear canals so the small size did it for me. The left one slips out when I move my jaw too much but I made peace with my natural odd ear. I have a thing with having my devices below 50% battery life so I plug the JBL case as soon as it hits 60% and that alone lasts for two full days, keep in mind that I wear them about 4 hours on days that I work. On my days off, I wear them 6 - 8 hours and the battery life still makes it to the next day without going below 50%. They're comfortable, too. My ears haven't ached at all.

Now, this EQ change is dependent on your ear canal & ear cup size ‚Äî for me the vocal fundamental was buried. I have to use the large cups. JBL & other companies should make curves for different cup sizes, as their ‚Äúvocal‚Äù preset EQ boosted the nasal and harsh frequencies of vocals.

Yes",Matthew Mart√≠nez,5.0,"I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the ‚Äúlowest volume‚Äù. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I‚Äôd say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it‚Äôs enough when you‚Äôre at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I‚Äôd rate the noise cancellation pretty high.Pass through, pass through is good. I‚Äôd recommend not having the pass through when there‚Äôs lots of noise cause it‚Äôs good and personally it can get loud. When there‚Äôs a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I‚Äôm sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet I‚Äôve had it for 2 months now.Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it‚Äôs constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I‚Äôve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that‚Äôs a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it‚Äôs only on pair of beats at a time.I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I‚Äôm considering getting the studio pro‚Äôs over the AirPod max after this experience.Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it‚Äôs because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it‚Äôs still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don‚Äôt think AirPods Will have this problem. But I‚Äôm not sure.

R2BD35HL2C6JSK,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars Read this Review (I'll tell you why I settled on these after researching for months!),Tuck VB,5.0,"You're probably like me, dragging your feet for months, researching and researching for hours trying to compare brand names (Bose, or JBL? Sennheiser, or Apple?). I finally settled on these, and here's why:1) I didn't want airpods. You probably also don't want airpods (if you're even reading this review). Not because of the quality, but because ""everyone has airpods"" and they're ""airpod people"" (sorry to all the airpod people, including my sister). I wanted to be different (hopefully no shame there?).2) My top priority was phone calls with my earbuds (make sure, even if you don't end up with these earbuds, that you determine your priorities, -clearly-). These earbuds have some of the best ""in ear"" calling I've seen (next to airpods).3) I wanted something low profile (also why I didn't want airpods with the ""stem""). These are very sleek, and don't look flashy in the ear. They're also not very cumbersome, and fit very snuggly. Very light, but durable - great design, even better build quality.4) Not a huge selling factor for me personally, but if you want noise cancellation, this is your stop. I just used these this morning on the train coming into Boston, sitting next to the door leading out of the coach, and was astonished with how adaptive it was to specifically tuning out the rattling of the train. These earbuds will adapt to the environments around them!5) The battery life is fantastic. Keep in mind, if you're in a loud area with the noise cancelling on, and it's working harder, you're going to blow through your battery faster - even that considered, I was still really impressed with the battery life!6) This is clearly designed to work seamlessly with Apple products. Pairing was a breeze, and the connectivity is strong. Beats and Apple had a beautiful handshake with this product, and it shows.7) Lastly, the sound quality. This is unmatched with anything I've used prior. Has very clear audio, and a great range of tone. The bass is powerful, while balancing defined treble tones.A couple things to consider:-These don't have wireless charging (unlike my other gadgets). I need to plug them into USB-C to charge. Might not be a big deal for you, but this is a drawback on my radar.-Get a protective case! The existing charging case is well built, and sturdy - but if you're like me, and you put your phone in a protective case, do the same for your earbuds. The case I got was drop proof, and didn't add much to the size (it doesn't take up much space in my pocket). It was $10 for peace of mind.

R13FS9E750HR39,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Daily Use,IT Guy,4.0,"The media could not be loaded. Quick OverviewI bought these headphones to replace some other earbuds that were beginning to have issues and so far I have really enjoyed these headphones. Since these earbuds are made with Apple in mind, they have easy pairing just like Airpods. They also integrate with Siri to read your texts and notifications, etc. and give you a chance to respond which is a great feature I missed when using another brand. My only complaint at the moment is really just a minor inconvenience - because of the low profile of the earbuds they are harder to grab out of the case since only a few millimeters of the earbuds are sticking out to grab. If you have nails or bigger fingers you might find it annoying to grab out of the case.One of my favorite things about these earbuds is the fact that they have actual physical buttons, NOT have touch buttons. I wear hoodies and it‚Äôs so annoying when it brushes a touch button and pauses my music or turns noise cancelling on or off.Crisp and Clear Sound Quality:The sound quality is impressive across various genres of music. The earbuds deliver a well-balanced sound signature with clear vocals, detailed instrument separation, and a mostly satisfying bass response. The highs are crisp, without being harsh, and the mids are well-presented. The bass isn't as punchy as I would like, but with how small these earbuds are that is kind of to be expected. It does provides a good level of depth without overpowering the other frequencies, but if you like a lot of bass these might not be for you. Overall, the sound quality of will please most casual listeners alike and even some music enthusiasts. These earbuds lack customizable EQ settings. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I like to adjust the bass and the highs depending on the genre of music I am listening to.Comfortable and Secure Fit:These earbuds are designed with user comfort in mind. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight and ergonomic design make them comfortable to wear. I've worn them for about 4 hours at a time and will sometimes forget they are there. Personally the Airpods didn't fit in my ear as well and these stay in better for me.Great Noise Cancellation:I prefer active noise cancellation because the fit of passive noise cancellation is usually less comfortable. These earbuds have a solid fit and use active noise cancellation which I prefer - and is pretty impressive. Typically I like to hear my environment when walking my dogs but the noise cancellation is so good I have to turn it off. I could keep noise cancellation on with my old headphones and it really just reduced how loud the noise was. This is also really helpful when I am on a call and my dogs are in the other room. I usually have to keep muting my mic because my dogs are barking, but when testing my girlfriend couldn't hear the dogs while we were on the phone.Incredibly Stable Bluetooth Connection:The connection between these earbuds and my phone is absolutely incredible. Bluetooth connection quality can vary quite a bit but these have one of the most stable and reliable connections that I have ever seen with wireless earbuds. There is virtually no latency. I left my phone in my bedroom and walked about 100 feet and went outside into the backyard and close the door. There wasn't even a stutter with the connection. Amazing.Battery Life:There is always a claim of an impressive battery life with high end earbuds. I haven't had a chance to test yet, but I plan to drain the battery completely on the earbuds and the case and track how long it takes to charge, how long the earbud batteries last, and how long the case battery lasts. I will update this review once I have had a chance to test!Overall the Beats Studio + offer a great audio experience and sound quality, comfortable fit, and amazing wireless connection. While there are a few minor inconveniences, none of them are dealbreakers and these earbuds are a great choice for anyone seeking a good pair of wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AGYDMBJ7K2SRHYL7DHHL37MLHDUQ,1,195,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"May 19, 2023",2023-05-19,2023-05,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

Some create ear fatigue and discomfort after some time. I‚Äôve carried 2 different pairs of other buds to use based on whether I‚Äôm listening to music or talking on the phone.

R32J1YNX3NHKAE,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Thoroughly disappointed.,atomsk,3.0,"After having these for some time, I hate to say that I am thoroughly disappointed in them. I bought these to replace my trusty Bose QuietComfort Limited Editions that I‚Äôd had for maybe four years. Loved them. They died, and I wasn‚Äôt mad because they‚Äôd lasted through sweat, rain, dust, etc. Searched and searched for a replacement, bought these as I‚Äôd had good experiences with Beats products before. Total. Letdown. The audio quality is okay, but the noise cancellation is temperamental. Battery life is good, charging is good, but that‚Äôs about it. The fit is sketchy. They actually fall out of my ears when I sweat. I expect any earbuds to loosen or slip a bit, given my large, odd ears. These, actually fall out. I cannot get the fit to stay good, no matter what size cups I use. And the connectivity is bad. They routinely stop playing sound at random, and can only be restarted from my phone (which is an iPhone) and not from the buttons on the actual earbuds. They disconnect completely sometimes, too. Everything is updated, my device and the earbuds, still lackluster performance. Would not recommend or buy again.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AHAIK4T6PLM5KOSY4IOEZI5KKJWA,1,8,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"July 7, 2024",2024-07-07,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

R5M5AUQEOJMSM,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones with frustrating bug with iPhone,Laura G,3.0,"I like these headphones but there are some serious issues if you use these with an iPhone. Apple has owned Beats for a decade and when connected to Apple products, have a specific menu to control their functionality. I have a fully updated iPhone 11 Pro. Though it's not the newest phone, I should have to have the newest phone to use Apple-supported headphones.Pros:‚Ä¢ I can switch between my phone, my iPad, and Macbook pretty easily. I don't have to forget my headphones on one thing in order to connect to another.‚Ä¢ The sound quality is pretty good.‚Ä¢ They stay in my ears well.‚Ä¢ The physical button to pause or skip works well and has a nice feel.‚Ä¢ Control of settings like listening mode and button function are in settings on the iOS or Mac OS without needing a third-party app or toggling manually through features on the headphones themselves.‚Ä¢ When noise cancelling and transparent modes work, they work pretty well (see cons).Cons:‚Ä¢ From day 1, these have had problems staying connected to my iPhone. If I pause or don't have audio playing for a short period of time (usually around 30 seconds though it's happened after about 15 seconds), the headphones disconnect. They will then attempt to reconnect but with no sound. You have to go into Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headphones, wait, and then reconnect. This is when the screen is active and being used, so it can't be blamed on the iOS going into a sleep mode or because the screen is dark. It happens on a daily basis if I pause to talk to someone or if I'm taking a moment to select my next song or YouTube video. Apple Support is no help as their solution is to forget the headphones and re-add them. This fixes the problem for less than a day. I don't have the issue if I'm connected to my laptop or iPad. Yes, my iOS is fully updated and yes, the headphones are fully charged. Again, this has been since I opened them and started using them.‚Ä¢ After six months of use, the left earbud has an on and off thumping when I'm in noise cancelling or transparent mode. It's so bad, I've just resigned myself to not using either mode unless I have to.‚Ä¢ No wireless charging option. This might be due to Apple proprietary tech, but it's still a con.‚Ä¢ Approximately every two or three weeks, I can't change the noise cancelling settings because my phone thinks both headphones are out of the case (you can't use noise cancelling or transparent mode with one earbud). I would have to turn my phone off and restart it to get the modes to work again.Overall, the headache these headphones cause is not worth the convenience of their auto compatibility with Apple products or their sound quality. Apple needs to look into the bugs for iPhone and not brush them off. Won't be buying again and I'm looking for a new alternative to Apple Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGX7ZX53ATOLBXKS3QMWZIUUG4AQ,1,17,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"April 2, 2024",2024-04-02,2024-04,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device
R23SDD6BSLWDKT,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Annoying features.,cargill,4.0,"First of all, the transparent buds look really good. They sound really good and do a good job blocking out noise. The battery life is impressive. But I didn‚Äôt love them for the little quirks. I‚Äôve gotten use to my AirPods, which stop music/podcasts automatically when I take them out of my ear. These do not, which is annoying when you have to quickly remove the bud for one reason or another (like work). The real kicker, though, came when I would get phone calls and my phone would connect to the buds IN THEIR CASE in my purse in my car, when I was several feet away. While impressive with the range, it was annoying and inconvenient.Also of note, the case randomly started beeping incessantly while it was just sitting on my desk with both buds in it. Maybe I got a defective pair, but that was the final straw in deciding to send them back.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AGJB2SBKA24M347ZQBY6AVP4MPAQ,1,0,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"July 30, 2024",2024-07-30,2024-07,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

I drop them frequently and if I was in the wrong place, I could easily lose one or both. I would love to see a rubberized exterior or something else to make it easier to handle these, otherwise excellent ear buds.

I have 1 more complaint and it may just be me but people have a hard time hearing me when I take a call with them on. 90% of the time I have to take them out to finish my conversation.LoveOn a positive note the battery life is really good. They send out 2-3 warning alerts to let you know the batteries are nearing the end of their life. it‚Äôs great because it gives you plenty of time before your cut off. If your like me and only wear 1 at a time, the alerts gives you lots of time to switch out to the other bud before your cut off.I also love the noise canceling feature but if you don‚Äôt love it there is actually a setting that lets you turn it off.

RR59V1YTAKMN3,B0BZK2Z2TC,3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware if you are an AirPods user...,P. Liu,3.0,"For me, the battery life at around 75% volume is around 7h50m with ANC and Transparency set to Off. The sound quality, and I've owned several HiFi headsets including HiFiMan and Sennheiser's, is nothing ground breaking or it's just typical Beats. So it's okay if you know the Beats sound. For my ears, the default plugs works fine and doesn't appear to fall out.So, several things to note:1) it Does Not automatically switch sources on Apple platforms like AirPods does(you have to manually switch)! It does, however, pair once and connects to all of your devices under the same Apple ID. So it sits somewhere in between the traditional BT headset and an AirPods.2) The case is wider than AirPods Pro case by more than ~1/2"" and taller by ~1/4""... So, kinda big but pocketable.3) For reasons unclear to me, mine unit charges to 98-99%... Not sure what's causing that4) No iOS 'Fit Test' for these buds... So choosing the right plug is your call!5) One reason I'm debugging and still might return the item: On a phone call or FaceTime call, at some point in the call, the other person can not hear my voice until I switch back to either Speaker or iPhone. The little Googling I did suggest that I'm not alone in this, and switching to Speaker then Back to the Buds might recover the microphone. But it's unacceptable for my sound to drop out on a call and not knowing it's happening until the other parties mentioned it. Until I can resolve this, I won't be doing any phone calls or using the microphones on this thing... Unresolved, I will return it!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AF5USDTPPMDQCVOELHMZTQMMA42Q,1,1,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"June 30, 2024",2024-06-30,2024-06,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

Multiple chats have resulted in me giving up and using my gym headphones or the built in speaker. If these weren't a gift, i'd be upset as travel/in office is my main use case.

R2XXL0QN38E49T,B0BZK2Z2TC,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for calls,Kris Faultner,4.0,"I have been looking for a set of earbuds or headphones that I can use for work phone calls - meaning on the computer (Zoom, Google Meet, etc) that doesn't pick up every bit of noise going on around me. I have found many Noise Cancelling headphones block the noise out for me, but not for the callers on the other end.These work amazing when I am on my cell phone. I tested it out where I was driving with my windows down, then I turned my radio up. I record myself leaving a message so that I can hear what the other person hears. These did great blocking a lot of the sound out for the caller on the other end when on my cell phone.When on Zoom or Google Meet calls on the computer, these did a lot better than any others I had. It didn't do as well as when I was on my cell phone, but still blocked out some of the noise around me for the other callers.The downside to these is the fit. I have small ears and have trouble finding earbuds that will stay in my ear. Unfortunately, I have to adjust these often and I don't find them as comfortable, but, again, I have small ears. So for the average person, these would likely work well.If you are using them to listen to music, the sound quality is okay.

With my previous pair of earbuds it was impossible to talk on the phone with a loud background, it was impossible for the person on the other end of the line to hear.

It usually works, but sometimes something strange happens and the people I am talking to complain about the voice quality. This has nothing to do with the noise level because it happens in pretty quiet places as well.For listening to music and audio books it is excellent. My favorite thing is that each earbud can be used independently while the other one is charging. This means that I can listen to podcasts and audio books non-stop. Battery life is very good as well. ANC is excellent as well.The only complaint I have is with the microphone being flaky. Everything else is amazing.

RWUFM677B047O,B0BZK2Z2TC,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best out there but...,Honest Reviewer Zach,5.0,"This is hands down one of the best earbuds in the world period. Some cons that I've noticed after using them are.Cons:-The left earbud has low static sound when nothing is playing.-The earbuds pick up a ton of background noise with their microphones. But it's normal.-Note that it's impossible to speak to someone on the phone while, for example you're at a pretty loud gym.-Putting one earbud into the case, pauses whatever you're playing from your phone.-I personally never use transparency mode. However, when putting one earbud into the case, it always switches to transparency mode, and you have to manually change it on the app. The app doesn't allow to set default modes.Pros:-They are build very strong, and earbuds wouldn't come apart and break even if you step on them.-Earbuds are able to connect/link to two devices at the same time and switch between them seamlessly. Few earbuds have this capability if any.-Additionally, earbuds are able to link to your Google account and connect to devices much easier.Overall, very good noise cancellation, sound quality, decent bass, battery life, charging speed, design, feel, and look.Two month update: Sometimes the system notifications get messed up - it notifies you about the percentage of the case and both earbuds every 5 seconds. Sometimes one of the earbuds goes out, without a low battery warning. Putting them into a case for a few seconds fixes this. Also sometimes the noise cancelling gets messed up - it does the exact opposite - adds noise. Again putting both of the earbuds for a couple of seconds into the case fixes this.Six month update:I had to send this product for repair (directly to apple) tree times before all issues were fixed. The first two times, it was free, but the third time I had to pay $84 for them to get fixed.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AELKL63BZ7XFD27KO3R6BEVSDWRA,1,68,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"November 29, 2023",2023-11-29,2023-11,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

I bought these as a much needed replacement for my first gen AirPods that I purchased at launch. Thus far, I have used the earphones around the house while doing chores, relaxing on the couch, and at work. The sound quality is pretty good. While the earphones themselves have no equalizer settings, I mostly use Spotify and have been able to tune the buds to my desired taste through Spotify.The active noise canceling is easy to turn on/off and I was really surprised how well they work. My washing/dryer unit can be fairly noisy in my open floor plan apartment. I could not hear it running at all when I put the noise canceling on.I love the aesthetic of the buds and they fit perfectly in my ears out of the box. I do miss the feature of my AirPods where the buds would start/stop playing if it was inserted/removed from my ears. I can see myself accidentally putting the buds down and forgetting they are still going. I deducted a star because while the case and buds are stylish and sleek, I find they are a bit too smooth. the buds are a little difficult to firmly grasp and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll slip out of my fingers while handling them.

(Like the way you ""hunt"" for the right way to insert a USB cable. üôÇ) This feature improved usability for me and I'm mentioning here in case the manufacturer has anyone reading these reviews for future improvements.I like how you can use the app to customize behavior /settings of the earbuds, and really like how if you leave one inserted, it can (with the right settings) use amplification to make it so you're hearing normally, as though nothing is blocking your ear canal.I was used to other earbuds that were capacitive touch and wanted to point out that these are tactile touch, meaning you need to push the surface of the earbud to click the button. You'll feel a little click when it works each time but it's barely perceptible and not annoying.The only problem I had and ultimately had to return them is that I routinely had feedback on calls that the mics were inconsistently picking up my voice.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AFEHMC3NEQ5CJN4XTMXZZBK7NPCQ,1,5,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+,"January 14, 2024",2024-01-14,2024-01,Sony,Sony Portable Audio Device

RV3Z5674QO5SS,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly efficient quality buds once I equipped my old silicone tips.,Samuel Holland,4.0,"Edit 01/19/24Short and sweet-I use buds just about everyday.I liked the pixel buds more, and is why my xm4's will not accept a charge or turn on because after getting the pixel buds, I never used the XM4's again.We're here for XM5 though, so please excuse the rant.1st Sony customer service, second to none including Google who used to be pretty good(IMO)(pre-'so-called'pandemic).2nd -Stop right now and take a picture of bottom of XM5 case & package it came in(identifying Numbers). If u ever have issue you will need.3rd & final what you read for---‚û°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è My original review is below and still valid but after cleaning and adjusting tips, I'm happy to report I haven't had the 'connect from pocket problem'. Changing the tips made a big diff, but they're not near as secure and comfortable as pixel buds pro for my everyday use. That bring said, the pass through, pass thru blend, etc are the best hands down. Their competition isn't even close for this category(IMO_of_course).The only thing I find myself having to adjust often. They want to sit halfway in my ear, instead of locked into place. Many times when I go to adjust, I hit pause, which could be disabled in all fairness. I still use these as my everyday buds though, and are about to try more tips when I can find the time. They are superior in sound and especially the noise cancellation/passthrough/blend feature. It's actually amazing how good they are in all honesty. (If you don't like foam tips, get some silicone because these only come with the foam style.) (The tips are the same though as any other set.)I just wanted to come back and follow up.They deserve five stars.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê. I have to leave the one star off but if I could I'd rate them 4.7-4.8, so sorry it's not five stars for a pretty solid product.I hope this can help someone, and give yourself a day or two once getting to be able to see the difference, since they have some pretty solid picks out there. Thanks, & may the good Lord bless.‚ù§Ô∏èI had the 3rd & 4th Gen earbuds, so upon getting these, I was wondering did I make the right choice, coming from pixel buds pro? I'm happy to report, that after changing the tips to some older silicone traditional Sony tips, they surprised me how nice they were to use. I also was happy about the longer lasting battery, and quality passthrough experience then what I had gotten used to. All in all, these are pleasantly nice once I put the silicone ear tips on. They fit perfect now and have my recommendation. Edit- I've had a little time with them, and the couple things I don't care for so far, is Amazon music service; I disabled nearby devices, because every time I connect buds after accepting update, they offer a service to be ready to play music with a tap. It's good if that's what you want, but not for me at the time. Now the other issue is actually an issue that has me really concerned whether I want to use them long-term. The right ear bud every time I look is connected in the case/paired to my phone which is a dealbreaker if I can't seem to correct. I'm sorry to report this because it's something that matters a lot to me and a reason I would return to the pixel buds pro. Anyway the sound and noise cancellation is second to none , and I can honestly say, they close the pixel buds pro out of the water.

Find the right size earbud tips and find your personal sound preference on the app. Noise cancelling is good enough for me. Adaptive noise is not as great as it still cancels a lot but to be expected since an ear bud is in your ear. Charges nice. Lasts a long time for me. I usually only use one earbud at a time for 8 hours. The Xm-4's did not perform as great for me, but these have been a lot better.

R39IFB4SI371KS,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars I really wanted to like them,Jonathan M. Silveira,3.0,"PROS- Very tiny and pocketable case with a flat bottom (stands up on its own)- Lightweight and small earbuds- ""Bragging rights""CONS- Very slippery/glossy earbud sides- ANC on and off sounded 100% the same to me- Case felt cheap/fragile- Sony app is a disaster/often did not recognize earbuds even after connecting to Bluetooth- Battery life wasn't all thatI bought these buds to replace my aging Jabra 75t Active. They supposedly sounded amazing and had top tier ANC. They do sound slightly better, but ANC didn't work for me at all. I tried all ear tip sizes multiple times, tried jamming them into my ears to the point of hurting myself, and ANC did not work at all. I'd turn it on and off a bunch of times in a row and heard absolutely no difference whatsoever. I knew the right fit was very important for ANC to work and tried everything I could. So either I have alien ears or my earbuds were defective.The sides of the earbuds are glossy and very slippery. It's difficult getting them out of the case. I felt like I never really had a good grip on them and was deathly afraid of dropping my very expensive earbuds. The feeling is the same taking them out of my ears to put them in the case. Being constantly afraid of dropping them didn't work for me.The hinge and the top half of the case felt really thin and cheap. It felt like it could snap in half with just a little bit of force. Not a huge issue, though.The Sony app is a clusterduck of epic proportions. It's like they put the sales committee in charge of designing it. It's just awful in every way. Everything is hidden in an unnecessary menu and has a weird name/description. And having to create a Sony account to use certain features was the last straw.I expected much better battery life according to their specs. It'll probably last the full 8 hours, but don't count on it if you need them for something important towards the second half of your day. They did last longer than my aging 75t Active, but not by a substantial amount. I had ANC on at all times, trying to notice any difference between having it on of off. I never tested the battery life on these with ANC off.Other than Sony's app not recognizing the earbuds after connecting them to Bluetooth, I had zero issues with connectivity. They connected every time and I never experienced drops.I just didn't get enough benefits to justify the price of these earbuds. I then bought the Jabra Elite 8 Active and, although they're not ""high-end"" (no bragging rights), they're a huge upgrade to everything I care about. The ANC works very well and I barely have to place the earbuds in my ears. They're a lot easier to grip and feel secure in my hands and ears. The battery life is absurd. I charge my case once every 5 or 6 days (with ANC on 24/7). If I turned it off, I might not have to recharge them until next year.I've been eyeing Sony's earbuds since the XM3, but never felt they were worth the price vs. features. After the XM5 came out, I finally thought there was a chance they were good enough. Unfortunately, that didn't happen to me.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2024",AFNCA6NW243WSGZNHIWBJ4RGFVXA,1,4,Color: Black,"April 30, 2024",2024-04-30,2024-04,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
RAGFSOGI67D6,B0C345M3T7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Clear, quiet, smaller and lighter than the XM4",Someone,4.0,"I use a range of Sony headphones and earbuds, from the MDR-Z1R to the IER-M9 to consumer models like the WH-1000XM and WF-1000XM series. It all depends on where I am (at home, on the go locally, or traveling) and what equipment I'm using (a Sony digital music player with a balanced headphone output jack or Bluetooth LDAC support, or a simple iPhone that only supports the Bluetooth AAC codec).My WF-1000XM5 pair arrived July 28, 2023 (the day before I wrote this review). After testing them and completing the initial update to the 2.0.1 firmware (by the time you read this, there may be a newer version), I found that I just left the earbuds in for the rest of the day, whether I was listening to music, making calls, or enjoying some quiet time. They're smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than my WF-1000XM4 pair, to the point that I don't really notice I'm wearing them.Sound-wise, there is a noticeable improvement in bass and in the midrange. I didn't notice much of a difference in treble, although I like less bass and more treble than the average person (hence my choice of the IER-M9 over the two alternatives in that product line).The noise-canceling has improved across the board. As always, it's important to try the different tips, including the possibility that you will need a different size in each ear. I was surprised to see that mentioned in the in-app tutorial!I am used to third-party expanding foam tips for my WF-1000XM4 pair, so we'll see whether third-party vendors offer something similar for the new model. For now, the stock tips work fine. They remind me of the alternate-texture tips that come with the IER-M9.Now, a few flaws, worth mentioning given the price of this product...First, Sony's model numbering is stupid and not consumer-friendly. Normal people can get excited about ""AirPods"" but not about ""WF-1000XM5s"".Second, the charging case, though now significantly smaller, still lacks any sort of finding feature. It would have been a simple matter for Sony to add the ability, through the clunky Headphones Connect app, to make a pair of earbuds in the case play a loud sound so you could find the case if you'd misplaced it. Apple of course makes precisely locating its products very easy.Third, in their hubris, product designers at Sony have made something small and lovely but forgotten about the environments in which it will be used. There is NO tactile feedback to let us distinguish the left earbud from the right. The L and R marks are tiny (just millimeters tall) and the use of dull grey for L and red for R makes them invisible in the dark. If I'm out walking in the evening without the case, have taken off the earbuds for a moment, and am putting them back on, I should not have to use my iPhone's flash to tell left from right.Last but not least, the Headphones Connect app is becoming an ever more elaborate trainwreck. There are just too many options and features. With no distinction between what's essential and what's not, you have to open three tabs in succession, scroll down, and open endless settings panels (each accessed by a gear icon) to cover everything. Pesty notifications come back every time you start the app, even if you deleted them the last time. Sony tries again and again to make you sign up for various accounts, and is of course gathering information about you, your cell phone, and your listening activity every time you use their app. Since Sony's 360 spatial audio only works with a handful of paid, proprietary music apps (a big gap, compared to the more-or-less universal, iOS-level support for this feature with Apple wireless headphones and earbuds), I don't even bother setting it up.Overall, the WF-1000XM5 is an excellent pair of wireless earbuds in terms of sound, noise canceling, and comfort, and Sony could make improvements by renaming them, adding a raised plastic dot to make the right earbud distinguishable by touch, and ditching the Headphones Connect app in favor a lightweight (and ideally, data-privacy-conscious) control panel.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023",AGVLBVPSFJOBQEMVAK5P6VZFA22Q,1,184,Color: Black,"July 29, 2023",2023-07-29,2023-07,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

They fit well (which took a bit of user-error to get right), but because they offer so many options for use it's taking me a bit to learn which taps where produce the desired effect of controlling volume rather than calling someone. I much prefer these to Shokz Openrun bone cancelling headphones in the gym, which I used to use, because I can exclude grunting and yelling emanating from some of my weight-lifting comrades. And they aren't affected by sweat like over-ear noise-cancelling headphones, which I also tried. Why, you might ask, not immerse myself in the sounds of the gym?

The sound profile is different than the XM4s, but I hear more detail than before. I also agree the ANC relies more on passive than active cancelation, so a correct seal is crucial whereas it was less crucial on the XM4s.Once I used the autoeq, and fully setup Wavelet, the XM5s are clearly an upgrade in sound quality.I have yet to fly with them, but next time I do I'll update that part. So far no hissing, pressure, or oddness though, so I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews.

The fact of the matter was the xm4 left was only charging 40per and the R wasnt much better. After only 4 months of a refurb purchase on AMZ. However, the sound and noise cancelling was outstanding, so I bought a set of XM5s here on AMZ.Bottom line- much better overall. An issue I had on Android was FLAC and wav files skipping. Its always been the case. Seems like this has been fixed- finally! as the XM5s havent skipped once, during hours and hours of play so far. The audio is improved- it sounds really quite excellent. The noise cancelling has taken a notch down. Not sure why- but it is not very good now. Ive read many comments from other complaining the same. Its all a tradeoff, no doubt Sony engineers put more emphasis on sound quality and no skipping. All in all, they are still my go-to choice for earbuds. I hope the battery holds up longer than the xm4. When you have something so good- the biggest fear is losing it... I just hope they keep working/stick around!

R357ZLBP3YRC07,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2,Janine,4.0,"I'll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I'm shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness. It's unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production? It's genuinely worth removing a star for. They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing. It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right. There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison. If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it's like you've got nothing at all in your ear. It is THAT good. The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted. The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter. They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones. They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4. I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything. The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted. It's probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn't try. Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/""fake"" and undefined at the same time. Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking. But they're great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane). So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win. Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music. So for the gym, Sony's win.But really, for most people, it's a toss-up. I wouldn't recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort. If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don't look back. If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I'll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case. Probably a little light sanding to the shell, or a few tiny dots of epoxy","Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023",AE6ACY5ETVCP4TYOU6DXABPL53IQ,1,10,Color: Silver,"November 23, 2023",2023-11-23,2023-11,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R274ZGSZLMKFAL,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as I hoped, I am returning them.",Paul M.,3.0,"I am a big Sony fan with 6 of their top TV models, 4 cameras, and 5 pairs of head and ear phones in our family. Unfortunately, I have watched their top of the line designs (TV's and headphones in particular) change from 'cost no object quality products' to designs that are purposely simplified and cheapened to save in manufacturing costs. A good example is the change from the XM4 headphones to XM5 models with the later looking like a sub $100 pair of headphones with weak pivot points, poor folding size, large case, cheap plastic, and thin bass sound. Those headphones at least improved the mids and highs...which I cannot say for these WF-1000XM5 earbuds. It seems Sony finds some great wins, then removes those that work in the next revisions to be different and does not listen to their customers. An example is the effective voice confirmations in mode changes that now are replaced with beeps and some modes being removed. This is very helpful in flights, when there is a lot of ambient noise.These WF-1000XM5 earbuds epitomize this cheap concept in being too slippery (what happened to the nice matt finish in XM4's), awkward to handle and insert, weird fitting in the case as they rock around not making contact, and exuding a boomy cheap sound. The case seems like it was designed for a different product. To be clear, I gave them plenty of time to break in and though they improved...they plateaued way too soon. I understand cost savings are important, but these earphones are $300 and marketed as their best and these do not exude quality like their previous models and this is immediately obvious. The gloss finish is very slippery, not ideal for handling and looks cheap. The attractive bronze (rose gold?) accents from the past are all but gone. They are moderately comfortable but leak sound making you constantly guess whether or not ambient sound is on or off. Touch control seems more irregular and modes are removed. Conversely, I have found my XM4's (I have 2 pairs) to sometimes cause mild pain in my ears over long use which I did not experience with these XM5's though the XM5 for me feel like they are falling out with their more rounded shape.The soundstage is muddy and closed in and does not outperform the XM4 earphones, in my opinion. Some music with perfect recordings sounds OK, but across the board they fall short in getting the best out of the music and I listen to many types of music. Just like the WH-1000XM5 headphones (which I returned to keep XM4's), these are no better sounding than their predecessors and for me the sound quality is first and foremost. Accuracy has always been Sony's forte but I have found that has changed. I have high end audio equipment including tube amps, and a full home theater so admittingly I might be a little picky; however previous models from Sony have kept me content and not a single flight I take is without their headphones or earphones.The ANC and phone call quality are very good but as the foam does not seal well there is that sound leakage in my ears no matter which tips I tried or how I turned them...meaning many will have to buy aftermarkets right away to get that softer better conforming ear pad...which is not a requirement with many of their competitors. I truly feel like Sony's design team did not spend enough time to cross the t's and dot the i's for these headphones and the budget was too low for a high quality design. The battery life is worse than previous models and I tested them side by side with XM4 using the same settings and same volume. They are smaller...for those who need to save space but I would prefer sound quality improvements over reduction in size. They are also more efficient with less more volume from a lower setting on my S23 Ultra.I did the prepurchase for these earphones and use my others daily but unfortunately I returned them and will stick with the previous models as I try others...which is disappointing. I was surprised about the many positive professional reviews and it does make me feel like they could be a little biased.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2023",AFKFGM46ICLUVJTWLHT4IJ2F62EQ,1,61,Color: Black,"August 24, 2023",2023-08-24,2023-08,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

Purely subjective audio comparisons between my favorite over ear headphones were amazing, however the tips (the swappable part which actually fits in your ear) degraded and the coating stripped away within 2 months of use. Sony provides different sizes to fit different ears, HOWEVER, you can not buy additional tips on their own. So if you lose it or it degrades as mine did, you're screwed. I'm currently awaiting delivery of a pair of third party XM5 eartips, hopefully they save the day. 10/10 audio quality and comfort, 10/10 battery life and charging speed, 0/10 on the longevity of the eartips.

R2WKBVSP2REH6C,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good size, doesn't block noise with stock tips",Frisco,3.0,"My favorite ear buds were the Jabra Elite 75t, but unfortunately the volume in the right bud got too soft and they stopped making them, so I replaced them with the Jabra 7 pros. The Jabra 7 pros sounded better, but the case was too bulky, the microphones were useless (no one could understand me on phone calls), and they were super glitchy. Several times it became impossible to use both earbuds at once and I had to reset them, or one of the buds just didn't charge in the case. I got Elevoc Clear buds just so I could make phone calls, but having two pairs of earbuds was not practical. I thought of getting the Bose QC 2, but the battery life of 6 hours was just not enough for me. So when these Sony WF1000xm5 came out with an 8 hour ANC battery life, I thought they might be right for me...The good: The charging case is tiny, reminiscent of the Jabra 75ts--maybe even smaller. There's multipoint and all the features you could want. I had no trouble pairing them with my Pixel 7 pro and my linux laptop. I've tested on phone calls and people have no problem understanding me. So I don't know know if the mics are as good as the Elevoc clear, but at least these are good enough for phone calls (unlike the Jabra 7 pros). Unlike what is claimed in other reviews, there is a small little spike on top of the left earbud, so you can easily tell the left and right apart even in the dark.The bad: The noise cancellation did not work at all, because the ear tips don't seal in my ears. Fortunately, the Sony android app will let you test for this, but I tested all four tip sizes and couldn't get any of them to seal. Eventually what I did was take the tips off my Jabra 7 pros and put them on the Sony WF1000XM5s, and that got a seal. That's not a great solution because I still might want to use my Jabras as backup. (Moreover, the Sony ear tips have an ear wax filter, whereas the Jabras don't, so I'm worried this could be a long-term problem.) I ordered the both the AZLA Crystal and the AZLA XELASTIC tips, and found that the large XELASTIC tips worked well for me, but not the Crystal (even though Crystal is a newer supposedly better product). So now I have good headphones, but incurred an additional expense and shipping delay for tips on top of already expensive ear buds.Some more minor criticisms: The buds are a little hard to get out of the case because they are so smooth. The controls aren't quite as flexible as on the Jabra--there are just two configurations possible for each ear bud, as opposed to being able to attach any function you want to any action (single, double, triple press, etc.). I experienced one minor glitch, where the passthrough did not work on the left ear bud, even though I could switch between ANC and passthrough by tapping that ear bud; the problem was fixed when I put the ear buds in the case and removed them again.Overall, despite the issues, I'm excited to have a tiny pair of ear buds again that are good for both listening to media and making phone calls. I just think that for the price, this should be a product that just works out of the box and doesn't require after-market tips. Maybe my ears are weird, but I've never had a fit problem with either of the Jabra buds I owned, or the two pairs of wired Shure ear buds I had before that.

R1IPOULPY31C6F,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars June 2024: These are awesome. Noise cancelling is amazing.,Alex,5.0,"Recently started on a weight loss journey. Needed new sneakers and ear buds. Did my research. Decided to give XM5 a shot. No regrets.Shoutout to Amazon for resolving my initial delivery issue.First day I had a bit of a ear discomfort after wearing them for like 8 hours, but that's common for new ear buds. On day 2 I've had no issues. On day 3 no issues either.Battery in-ear lasts nearly an entire day. Looks like the case holds about 2 extra full charges. I could be wrong on my initial estimates though.App equalizer is great to use. A lot of templates are available online from other users. See my image for my settings. I think these are great for music.Sound quality is phenomenal.Base is there. Even with really heavy base, there are no issues. Quality is great.Tested it with the phone call as well. My parents told me that the voice quality is fantastic. Better than me talking into the phone itself. They also said they hear NO NOISE when I don't talk. And when I do talk, they could hear just a little bit of a wind, but it was really windy and I could even hear some wind whistling myself.(No whistles during music though) So whatever technology these ear buds have, it's good. I was doing dishes and they couldn't hear water or any plastic bag noise.I really hope these last me a couple of years at least. Definitely something I'd be recommending to my friends.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AHVGCAMLMSLA47MOFJE5RC7XK66A,1,2,Color: Black,"June 2, 2024",2024-06-02,2024-06,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R3T8L9J5JPEQLH,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing,tim stiffler,4.0,"I have had 3 different brand /model of wireless, noise cancelation earbuds in the last 4 weeks. The first pair were Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds 2. By far they had the best @ noise cancelation (I could hear nothing outside of the sweet music that they were creating. The sound quality was as expected from Bose. The set up was easy and quick. However, at the end of the week I was ready to trash them (I sent them back) - they would not stay connected to either my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my MSI WS-75 Workstation. They were good for about 10 minutes, and then would have to reconnect.I then decided to try something different - Beyer Dynamics is a big name in studio monitor quality speakers, headphones and mics. They have a solution - the ""FreeByrds""."" Three drivers in each ear - unsurpassed sound and clarity..."" They did have good sound, they stayed connected, but the noise cancelation was non-existant (The reason that I wanted new NOIsE CANCELING earbuds for). I have a pair of 12 yr old Bose wired earbuds that block more sound than those were, and they aren't (weren't) catigorized as being noise blocking or canceling. The set up was long and complicated. Those should be back at the music store today.So I sprung for about $100 more and ordered a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5's. They stay connected. They sound really good (as good as the Bose? It's been a few weeks, too long to honestly compair...but these sound really good), they stay connected (actually you can connect to 2 sources at the same time if you want), and the noise cancellation is amazing, but I think not quite as good as the Bose (why I gave them 4 starts instead of 5). The set up was a bit more compilicated than the Bose were, and these fit inside your ear canal, where the Bose where more of an external fit. I wish I would have gotten these first...oh, and battery life is great. With the Auto Abmient setting off, I am easily going to get 10 hours out of a single charge today - and that is sitting at my desk enjoying great music all day with no other sound to degrade what I am hearing...and the case is good for two full charges.Based on what I know after 4 or 5 days - I would buy these again.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AFB72QDWJBFQ5FVTUN7DDSZ3QDPA,1,39,Color: Black,"December 4, 2023",2023-12-04,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R10MW8VJCMCP3H,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars You need aftermarket tips,Jim W.,4.0,"I have had Bowers & Wilkens corded earbuds for years and the sound on those is superior to anything I have tried, including these earbuds. But the B&W buds died three times in five years with the same problem so I decided to move on, though I still believe B&W sound, be it speakers or earphones is superior to anything out there. But reliability is an issue. So after reading many reviews I decided to try these earbuds. I was really disappointed in the sound quality but the issue was I could not get an airtight fit with the tips provided. The test in the app repeatedly said that I did not have an airtight fit no matter how hard I tried to jam them in my ears or which tips I used. I noted that this was a highly returned item for Amazon and was about to join the crowd and return them. But before I did that I did some research on aftermarket tips and saw that many people who had problems with the fit of their Sony earbuds were able to fix the problem by using Complyfoam tips. So I gave them a shot, and they worked. I got an airtight fit confirmed by the app right away and they stay put and are comfortable for long periods. So with that fixed, my opinion is that these earbuds are not as good sounding as B&W but are better sounding than Bose. Noise cancellation is just okay with the tips provided but is excellent with the Complyfoam tips. Bose level noise cancellation with Complyfoam tips. But Sony really needs to provide much better tips to avoid all the returns. Given the cost of these earbuds, not everyone will be willing to fork out more money for aftermarket tips.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024",AF5O74ALZJFF6CCGAXGQ52IARIHA,1,4,Color: Black,"February 21, 2024",2024-02-21,2024-02,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

RTCP1TRJO3KJ6,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars XM5 vs XM4 vs AIRPODS PRO 2 -- WHY THE XM5s ARE GOING BACK,Charles Nordlander,3.0,"Ever since they were released, and until recently, the Sony XM4 earbuds have been my favorite, ahead of my AirPods Pro 2 and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2. I say ""until recently,"" because the most recent firmware updates to the AirPods Pro 2 dethroned the XM4 at the top. In fact, if you haven't heard the Pro 2 running the latest firmware, you haven't really heard them at all. I've had the Pro 2 since release date, too, and while I felt they were an excellent update to the first gen Pro, the XM4s still bettered them in ANC and sound quality. Not any longer. The degree to which Apple improved both ANC and sound quality through firmware updates is not something I would have believed was possible. In fact, for a recent trip that involved a 9 hour nonstop flight each way, I left my Airpods Max headphones at home, only took my Pro 2 earbuds and didn't miss the Max one bit.SO... I was very anxious to hear what Sony accomplished with the XM5s, 2 years after the superb XM4s. And after spending the past week listening to them, I'll be sending them back. My issues:Fit: The only way I could get a ""good seal"" per the Sony app was by using the largest ear tips, which I found grew quickly uncomfortable in my ear. Even then, I had to twist the earbuds in deeply ""just so"" or the app would tell me to adjust them again. WAY too finicky to achieve what was ultimately an uncomfortable fit anyway. I don't have this issue with the XM4s or my Pro 2s. Plus, the Sony XM5 tips include an ear wax filter which I'm assuming is there for a reason, so I'd be hesitant to replace them with more comfortable tips that lack a filter.The Thud: As others have noted, the XM5s very audibly ""thud"" each time your foot hits the ground when jogging, running or even briskly walking.ANC & Sound Quality: Sony has definitely bettered the XM4 somewhat in both areas. Not dramatically, but still there. Measured testing I've seen shows that the XM5 better the Pro 2 a bit in cancelling lower frequency noise while the Pro 2 does better in the mid and upper frequency sound. I'd call it a draw. Similarly, while I prefer the sound signature of the Pro 2 running the latest firmware--it's a more open, natural and less processed sounding to my ear--others might prefer Sony's bassier sound. Since neither is objectively ""better"" than the other, I'd call this a draw, too. BUT... you've got the fit and thud issues with the Sony. If you can't get the fit of the XM5s to ""seal,"" and stay that way, both sound quality and ANC take a big hit. Plus the thuds are a constant annoyance that can overwhelm the sound quality.Bottom line: the AirPods Pro 2 remain at the top of the pack for me. And while the XM5s definitely improve on the ANC and sound quality of the XM4s, they introduce new issues which, for me, negate these improvements and leave the XM4s my preference in actual day-to-day use. For these reasons the XM5s are going back. BUT... if you like the XM5 sound signature, can live with the thudding and can manage to get a sealed fit easily whenever you put them in, you'll be happy with the XM5s.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023",AGR2RTJI3ED3RVJ34KVRK7OO2BSQ,1,9,Color: Black,"August 6, 2023",2023-08-06,2023-08,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

R8G2XNS5K9IWO,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Sony has us fooled,Scott C,3.0,"TL/DR: Sony makes sleek looking, clean sounding headphones with all the bells and whistles, and they've parlayed that into an image of ""the best"". They're not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I'd even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony's app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony's basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it's better than average and generally inoffensive. ""Good enough"" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can't tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn't been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony's 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can't promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can't fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I've been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",AE7PVXZHCY3VWMP5HRD6H2SQEFDQ,1,14,Color: Black,"October 10, 2023",2023-10-10,2023-10,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R32VPS4DC4CEYI,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars A (slightly) flawed replacement,ihsan,4.0,"Let's cut right to the chase. Are they better than the WF-1000XM4?For me ... yes, with an asterisk we'll explore below.They are lighter and smaller than the XM4s, which is very welcome.The sound quality and ANC are ... probably better. It's too close. I couldn't really tell because...They come with absolutely terrible ear tips!The XM4s shipped with high-quality silicone tips in three sizes, as well as squishy memory foam ones in three sizes. The XM5s only come with a three-size assortment of thick, hard memory foam tips.Not only was I a fan of the silicone ones included with the XM4, but the foamies you get here are rather uncomfortable. They don't squish much, so they either natively fit your ears or they plain don't work well. I apparently needed a size in between M and S, as the M's gave me headaches from the girth, and the S's didn't seal, causing them to shift around while walking.Even the too-tight M's still produced a lot of the 'bump', 'bump', 'bump' noises you get when some part of the earbud/tip isn't perfectly stationary while walking. Lots of people can ignore this. I'm not one of those people.I tried my old silicone tips from the XM4s, and hooray for comfort! But the new buds sounded tinny with them, and the ANC suffered horribly. Clearly Sony retuned the software specifically for foamies.Eventually, I found a set of high-grade aftermarket foam tips which put everything in line. (I'm now using Airfoams Pro.) I never should have had to try multiple tip manufacturers to get top-grade earbuds to function like their predecessor (which worked perfectly right out of the box). This is a common problem reported by other reviewers, so prepare for the possibility for yourself.Overall, recommended.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2023",AFEWD5OIVTCGOQ44PWNT2JAFZIUQ,1,7,Color: Silver,"December 23, 2023",2023-12-23,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R2XHZGBRL7DIF3,B0C345M3T7,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones IF you know how to read,Adam F,5.0,"My review is going to upset some, but unfortunately after reading a few of the negative ones I felt the need to write my own.Background: after going through THREE pairs of Apple AirPod Pro 2 I decided to pick these up, and I have used them heavily over the last 24 hours (~3 hours of yard work in 90F+ heat, ~1 hour in the gym doing weights, ~20 minutes cardio running outdoors).TL;DR: Overall these headphones do what they claim, provide awesome sound quality (note: not an audiophile, audio geek or whatever) compared to my previous Apple headphones, and the ANC is spot on. YOU MUST USE AND CONFIGURE THE HEADPHONE APP to get the full functionality and experience with these headphones. Furthermore, you need to actually CONFIGURE these headphones. If you don't, you are missing 80% of the features (ANC, transparent mode, geofencing), at which point I just order a cheaper pair.Pros:- Sound quality is spot on for the price range.- Personally, compared to the Airpods the fit is a lot better. I do wear foam earbuds a bit with my actual noise cancelling headphones, so I am used to them and prefer them over the silicone ones.- WHEN CONFIGURED CORRECTLY, the ANC and transparent mode blow away the Apple Airpods. Hands down.- The app has some pretty sweet functionality, such as an EQ tutorial which allows you to finetune the sound to what you prefer without understanding frequencies, adaptive mode (basically detects what you are doing, walking or standing still, and either turns on ANC or transparent mode OR however you configure it), and there the gesture thing, although I think is a bit gimmicky, can be cool for some.- The actual controls are configurable on the headphones as well within the app, and they work sell with Mechanix gloves on.- Unlike others, I had no connectivity issues. Phone was in my left pocket, and earbuds were in. I am 6 foot tall, ~225lb for an example of distance between headphones and device.Cons:- You require the app. You have multiple people on here claiming things like ""oh there is no ANC"" or ""oh boy I can't get transparent mode to work"". Yea, because if you read the damn insert that came with the package you would realize the app is required. I will say that there is a TON of functionality that is baked in, but it is somewhat cumbersome to figure out. I am fairly technical, and I even had to Google a thing or two to find the appropriate settings.- The case feels cheap. The Apple Airpods, love them or hate them, has a premium feel to the case, whereas these headphones are not exactly the best.- The adaptive mode is bit of a PITA to configure, especially if you are using these for the ANC to ensure you aren't blowing your ears out. For example, if I whistle it thought I was talking and then would shut the music off. It finally learned that it wasn't me actually talking but whistling, but still an annoyance. Furthermore, the adaptive mode will turn on transparent mode IF you are running/walking, and this occurred when I was using my mower. Not the most pleasant feeling.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2023",AEVIODKPSLXV7IOKW2UGXLSPEDTQ,1,159,Color: Black,"September 4, 2023",2023-09-04,2023-09,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R3K0LCJ8WSEFOW,B0C345M3T7,2.0 out of 5 stars Shockingly bad user experience...,G. Davis,2.0,"I've used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I've used, to a degree I'm struggling to comprehend. Let's get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It's better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let's start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It's crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony's implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can't be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can't be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky ""fast switching"".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud's battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren't so finicky.In closing, I'm surprised Sony released such a poor product. They're so bad that it's tarnished my view of the company.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AGPHPG2FTG2TRHFMZO7HGVSPKOIQ,1,68,Color: Black,"November 15, 2023",2023-11-15,2023-11,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

So I have tried a ton of stuff on the market from basic low end stuff to Bose QCs and the Sony offerings. I've always been a fan of the sony line of truely wireless earbuds since the first time I tried them. The sound profile has always been much to my liking and I've always felt like the noise canceling worked pretty well.These XM5s however just miss the bar. The bass from these is terrible. There are better bass notes on the lower priced Link Buds S. That said, the sound is generally clearer and higher quality than the Link Buds S otherwise. In fact other than the bass these are definitely some of the clearest and high quality sounding ear buds I have ever tried.As for noise canceling, I really don't know what Sony did here but it's seems to be a step down from the XM4s. If I compare them back to back sitting in the same location with the same ambient noises and noise canceling on, I hear a lot more sounds getting through on the XM5s. I can hear the AC unit in my room with them on where as with the XM4s I cannot. I'm positive I'm using the best ear bud fitment for me (as I said before I buy and try out a lot of different earbuds, so I know how to chose the correct bud size). I don't know if it's just an inferior chip with them trying to reduce size and extend battery, or if it's just bad firmware that needs to be patched.As for the fit / weight, they are more comfortable than the XM4s. I've worn them now for multiple 3 - 4 hour sessions and never had any discomfort from them. They are noticeably lighter and smaller than the XM4s. I will mention the glossy exterior and smaller size does make them a tad tricky to get out of the case. Could also be the magnet holding them in is stronger, but I've slipped trying to pull them out a couple of times now.Battery life I would call on par for modern day ear buds. Nothing amazing, but definitely would consider it good. Even after a 4 hour session with ANC on the lower of the two earbuds was still at 33%. They claim 8 hours but that is only if you have ANC and everything off.Overall as I said, these are good ear buds, just disappointing that the ANC seems worse, and the bass tones are so bad.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2023",AFH23JSGQS4ICPUR5H6CEEOC6RTA,1,54,Color: Black,"September 25, 2023",2023-09-25,2023-09,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R3TYKIZ0H1F9BD,B0C345M3T7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Yes, It worth an upgrade!",Naji,5.0,"I was looking for the best noise canceling earbuds as I was tired of using a mediocre Galaxy Buds 2. So I started my research on earbuds that I can use for long hours and don't want to feel pain in my ears. Since I had Sony over-the-ear headset WH-1000XM4, I decided to go for Sony. I picked up XM4 earbuds from Amazon, connected with my Galaxy S23 Ultra and right away I was blown away by the crisp sound quality of XM4. I used it for a week, however, it was not comfortable at all. XM4 are bigger, heavier and the overall design is bulkier. So I returned those after getting pain in my ear canal and I completely dropped the idea of using in-ear buds. I bought Apple Airpod Pro 2 to counter the experience that I have just had with XM4 because it was cheaper than WF-1000XM5 and was highly rated. Though I am using Android flagship, but Apple Airpod Pro 2 can be configured using an ipad and macbook which I already have so I was able to configure it and use it with my Android phone. Other than spatial sound, I could use the Airpods pro 2 at their best. To my surprise, Airpods work amazing with Android espacially after I installed equilizers and increasing the bit rates. It even sounded better than when connected to an ipad. But within a week, I started to feel that it doesn't create an air tight seal to give the best music quality possible. I almost lost an Airpod without noticing that it fell out of my ear. Also while walking around, moving head too much, Airpods tend to get lose. I gave up on those also as it was not justified to pay premium price but not getting the features I need.So I went to the latest and greatest WF-1000XM5. These are smaller than XM4, lighter, made with premium material and you can tell right away that these earbuds are top notch. I connected my phone, enabled LDAP (Sony proprietary codec for bluetooth) and then up the bitrate in Android developers mode to maximum. Gave it some reverb and slightly increase the mids of XM5 and wow they sounded best of all that I have tried so far. It has memory foam tips, which are not that bad in the ear. I can wear those for hours without noticing that I have something in my ear. It creates a good air tight seal, ANC is amazing, sound quality is great. Some people have complained about ANC not be that good in crowded place, but in my use case I haven't encountered a situation where ANC is not up to mark. I personally think it was worth an upgrade from XM4 and it has given me better music on S23 Ultra than using Airpods. Sony knows how music sound great. These are earbuds until Sony makes the next upgrade XM6.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AHBKZEGCOV7TPXD7B2SWJYD7SG3Q,1,27,Color: Black,"September 12, 2023",2023-09-12,2023-09,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

The batteries always last a whole day, often well into a second day. A third day depends on use and to my memory would be around about 10%-ish percent battery life. Activating noise cancelling does not make a loud environment seem much quieter, but there is an obvious improvement to the sound quality. If I can't understand a podcaster over the environmental volume, noise cancellation has always been a reliable solution to clarify his voice. My only complaint is what to my layman ears a lack of bass. But that's to be expected from such a small device. As well that the microphone quality is quite disappointing for phone calls but functional, though its microphone cannot handle louder environments like the noise canceling can.

After using and experiencing problems with both the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro Gen 2 I decided to switch to the Sony earbuds despite using an iPhone. The noise cancellation is leagues above Apple products (in my opinion) and the commonly disputed transparency mode feels equally as good as Apple earbuds. The comfort of these earbuds is unmatched and I have never felt uncomfortable while wearing them, while the Apple earbuds and other wireless earbuds I have tried (Skull Candy etc...) fall out of my ears easily these don't. I can wear them for long hours studying or writing reports and not having to worry about them being uncomfortable or the battery dying. This is preferential so I won't talk about it as much, but after properly modifying the equalizer on the Sony app they sounded the best of any wireless earbuds in my experience.TLDR: These earbuds are phenomenal, if you aren't stuck on the Apple ecosystem, absolutely give them a go as they are worth the money","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AF4DNCSBKFDO3TILUUWRGU44A2YA,1,2,Color: Silver,"June 2, 2024",2024-06-02,2024-06,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R3LR2CIMTNNYB4,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars These are nice, but bluetooth buds just aren't there yet",Jeff S,3.0,"Let me start off by saying that I have a pair of Sony WFL900 ear buds and they are my go to set. I also have several others from Anker, JBL and some wired ones as well. The WF-1000XM5 are good, the feature set is nice, and they are made well. The biggest flaw is bluetooth in my opinion. Listening to high quality streams and high bitrate audio, these sound nice. They sound a little better then my WFL900s but, they also fit the ear better and block outside sounds. The WFL900 have a pass-through hole, so outside sounds will get in your ear. The WF-1000XM5 are good. But are they $300 worth of good? No. Not by a long shot. Back when our phones had a wired connection I bought a really nice pair of Shure wired ear buds. These were so good, you could hear things you didn't hear before. The WF-1000MX5 probably will do the same thing, if the bluetooth audio wasn't compressed within an inch of its life. I have a current generation phone, so I can't imagine that is the issue. After trying 3 other ear buds, I've come to the conclusion that bluetooth ear buds are just OK. They will never be really good and you shouldn't really spend more money then you are comfortable with, considering you will probably crush or lose these within a year. Going back to my old Sony WFL900 until something else comes out.

R2QOWD1ZKJN8Z,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid earphones you will be happy,Symon,4.0,"The media could not be loaded. First let's just address price. Yes these are high because they are new. there are other options available but if you are looking then maybe you have the budget. Since the xm4's can be found roughly $99 used and 150 new, I would personally value these maximum $75 over current xm4 market prices. I'm just trying to compare apples to apples.Here is my rant about what sucks comparing these strictly to the xm4s.For a 2-3 yr wait for these...Sony could have done better with two design items, but more importantly, the app and features. Options for Pre-programed touch pad control have gotten slightly worse. yes worse. The startup tone cannot be disabled. It's a more pleasant tone than the 4's but yeah. at least I could turn them off. Volume control is both worse and better at the same time (in MY opinion) You have to rapid tap to increase/decrease. The glossy plastic on the earbuds are too slick. See video for the nudging requirements to remove the buds. especially if u got chonk sticks like me. The interface app is just getting out of control with the extra features and advertisements. I prefer simple.. Don't upgrade for these if you have the 4s. not worth it too me.My rant about what is better.Case size definitely got better, Earbud size is waaay more ergonomic. I got comfy with the xm4's, so they were good but this definitely stepped it up.. Music sound quality is noticably +1 over the xm4's version. The best way to describe it, is that every sound note is literally a hair more sharp and crispy. Play with the custom eq you will find something you like. other than that yea still top notch anc, good call quality connectivity etc... and all that extra stuff. You really start splitting hairs at some point for non professionals music people.Overall I'll give it 5 starts if you are upgrading from $30-$70 earbuds.If you are going from xm4's to xm5s (or any other high known flagship) I'd rate it 2 stars so save your money. (at least until they change the software features, IF they do)I don't have competitors buds to compare but I would estimate it at 3of5 stars.

If you think AirPods are the premium for sound and noise canceling, move along child. You're not here for the adult section.If you're here for actual sound, noise, canceling, audiophile level feeling, and solid improvements each update? Read on. I've had the last three editions, of the XM3, XM4, and XM5. I love the XM4 so much, I bought each color, one for work and one for everything else.First, the size of the case. This was one of my biggest gripes with the XM4. Obviously it was a huge difference from the XM3, but that's the first thing that you notice as soon as you see this with the XM5.The earbud pieces are quite similar, the essentially the ones fit the XM4s and the XM5, but they are much more hollow, and because of this you can wear them much longer compared to the XM4s, without having an earacheThe sound is superb. The additional codecs are quite impressive, and multi-point are even more impressive than they were when they came on to the XM4s.Somehow the already best in class (and yes I say that in comparison to all of the other headphones, because I have them all, AirPod pro 2s included) has somehow gotten even better. The other thing that I use constantly is transparency mode with one earbud in, so that I can walk around at work in a hospital and still hear everything around me while enjoying my music, which makes it a much more relaxing atmosphere.I've charged it once and since I've received them, and have used them pretty constantly all week. A few hours on and off, and I still have about 50% of battery life on transparency mode. I've used both earbuds with noise canceling for about 2 or 3 hours a day, while I do my notes, and just as comfortable.It's great for phone calls, and I love actually using the controls to control both the sound and the phone calls.All in all, this is the best headphones that I have both for work, play, and while steep in price, I don't think you will be disappointed.I know a lot of people feel that the app itself is overwhelming, but quite honestly, once you get the hang of it, all of your headphones sync the settings with only mild changes with each headphone. So all of my settings from the XM4 are past forward, and then the new settings that apply to these headphones, I can add in. Not all settings are required to be used, and I turned several of them off, including Google Assistant, additional notifications, etc.If you want a real world, real user, multi headphone enthusiasts review, this is it.

They are slightly more comfortable in the ear, but not as easy to get a seal, since they can spin in your ear more freely. The battery life issues that plagued the previous generation (the reason Sony bought them back from me) are supposed to have been addressed, but time will tell. Active noise cancelling is again great, as long as you can get a good seal. The buds come with multiple sizes of foam and silicone tips. These are the good things.The bad:... the sound. This is a big one, and I am very dissapointed here. They may sound great to some, but comparing to all the buds I own - The WF1000-XM4, Denon Perl Pro, Galaxy Buds, Pixel Buds 2, they aren't as good sounding. I don't know what it is exactly, but the sound is way worse than the XM4. It sounds overproduced or artificial. It leaves me wanting for something more, something the XM4 gave me. I tried the customized sound profile in the app, but it doesn't seem to do much, and doesn't give the quality I am used to. If you crank the sound up they come alive a bit more, but they are too loud to listen to comfortably or for long periods.Overall they are not bad buds, and if you can catch them on sale they are worth a try, however, they did not deliver the sound I expect from Sony. I personally feel they put too much focus on making them smaller and lighter. These aren't earbuds that I would buy to go to the gym or run with, I bought them for the Sony sound quality, and unfortunately, this was a miss by Sony in my opinion.

RT61N0HBRPYVZ,B0C345M3T7,"3.0 out of 5 stars Poor fit, I guess",Clams,3.0,"I got these after reading good reviews and having connection problems with two different pairs of Bose QC ii earbuds. I had previously tried the xm4s, and they were good but too large for my ears and hurt after wearing them just 30-ish minutes. When I got these, I couldn't understand why the reviews had been so good. The ANC was just horrible. Definitely worse than the Bose and the XM4s. I've had them a couple of weeks and tried many different sets of ear tips and couldn't get any improvement. I mostly use earbuds at the gym, and with these, I could still clearly hear background noise and music, even over the sound of my own music. Sometimes the noise comes through so clearly that I can't believe the ANC is even turned on.Finally after two weeks using them, I tried pressing them further into my ears and holding them there. When I do that, the ANC is great, but they won't stay in that deeply unless I hold them, so I'll need to return them. Apparently these are just not a good fit for my ears and I can't get a decent seal.Other:*The multi-point connection is great and works really well. It's ridiculous that the Bose doesn't have that.*Battery life is as advertised.*These are much smaller and more comfortable than the XM4s. The case size in a lot smaller and convenient.*Having to tap four times to adjust the volume is stupid and annoying.*No ""find my device"" feature. I got a case and attached a Tile. Another ridiculous feature omission.*The earbud volume is not synced to the phone volume, at least not on my Pixel 7. This means that if I use the phone buttons to change volume, it will only change up or down to the point that the earbud volume is set at. If you want max volume, for example, you would have to max the volume on your phone and max it on the earbuds. The Bose were not like this. Adjusting the volume on the earbuds brings up the volume control on the phone.I decided to buy a used pair of the original Bose earbuds. I'd previously owned them and sold them when I got the Bose II. They are big and ugly, and the case is too big, but they worked properly without any of the issues or frustrations I've experienced with the Bose II and Sony XM4/XM5.

RY2I7FXPDUKGT,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars *Early Impressions* A Marginal Upgrade To Their Already Great WF-1000XM4‚Äôs,April Villaaa,4.0,"Coming from the previous model, the WF-1000XM4, these feel pretty familiar. Although the shape has been slimmed down, the fit is pretty similar but slightly less bulky and yet pretty comfortable.They come with more ear tips allowing a tight seal for a wider variety of ears (SS, S, M, L) medium being the standard that come preinstalled out of the box.The default sound signature has changed slightly, but thanks to the Sony Headphones Connect app, there‚Äôs an 5 band equalizer with presets and their iconic ‚ÄúClear Bass‚Äù slider for the bass heads. These earbuds can also produce more ‚Äúrich‚Äù low bass frequencies. Allowing for nice sub-bass that does not sound muddy and overpowering, but rather strong and detailed (depending on your EQ of course).Ambient sound happens to be weaker and sounds slightly less natural compared to the AirPods Pro 2, but good enough. Noise cancelling has been improved with slightly better performance with sudden noises like bangs and clanks, and even better/noticeable improvement with voices, hums and rumbles.(PS: Ambient sound still sucks when it‚Äôs windy due to excessive wind-flap noise. But, wind reduction during noise cancelling has been improved!)Lastly battery. Which appears to be about the same as the last model (about 8 hours on the earbuds, 24 hrs with the charging case), but the charging of the earbuds in the case is much faster! 60 minutes of playtime from 3-5 minutes of charging is not too crazy of a claim.Now, keep in mind that the WF-1000XM4 had problems with battery malfunction. And although Sony did usually replace the many faulty units of the previous model, this is something to watch out for as there is no way to tell if they‚Äôve improved it until a few more months have passed.Conclusion; If you‚Äôre currently an owner of the WF-1000XM4, I would wait for a bigger update.

R3E1HECH05SPZ4,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Overrated,E7,3.0,"I have the Sony WF-1000XM4 and now the XM5. The XM4 battery life is terrible. They have issues with those so don't get those. The XM5 noise cancellation is great and the music quality is good but I have a few complaints. The earbuds don't stay in my ear when using the original foam tips. It's annoying having your hands busy at work and feeling your earbud shifting about to fall out. I had to buy aftermarket foam tips. The sound could be better and it's probably due to the foam tips letting the sound out. My 2nd complaint is they're not loud enough. Even with aftermarket foam tips, the earbuds are just not loud enough. I work in a noisy environment and it's hard to listen to podcasts with these. The noise cancellation only works if you have both earbuds in. It sounds like it wants to work when using one earbud but only when there's a really loud noise. It cuts the music momentarily and goes back to letting all the noise in. It would really help if it would work with only one earbud in because I wouldn't have any problems hearing whatever I'm listening to. I hate the touch sensitive controls. I wish they had a physical button that gave me a clicky feedback every time I press it. There is a tone whenever you pause or skip but like I said, it's hard to hear in a noisy environment. Most of the time, I have to raise my volume to notice if it paused, skipped or didn't register me pressing the touch sensitive controls. I originally bought these to use while I'm at work but now I only use these at home. For work I use the Beats Studio Buds which are louder, stay in my ear (with comply foam tips), have great audio and have a clicky button for the controls. No more guessing if I pressed the button or not. With the Beats Studio Buds I can now listen to the same podcasts I couldn't hear with my XM5s in the same noisy environment. I just bought the Studio Buds + which have a better battery life than the 1st gen. The XM5s are overrated in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023",AHLWZLKOSIIDQSKJVPHU4HHAQZMA,1,2,Color: Black,"December 2, 2023",2023-12-02,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds
R1HMOP3M3N6QZ1,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great new size and fit....sound marginally better.,mallory623,4.0,"I pre-ordered the WF-XM5s (black version) earlier this week and UPS delivered them this morning. I got them setup and connected to my iPad Pro, iMac, iPhone, Apple Watch and PC laptop. After using them for the better part of the day I personally don't feel any new great sound breakthrough or anything along those lines. The WF XM4's had a great balanced sound quality that I loved and they were my 'go-to' earphones for everything, over my Apple AirPods Pro, Kilpsch earphones, Bose Sound Comfort, Jabras and Master & Dynamics. This great balanced sound quality only continues in the WF XM5s. The overall sound staging is wonderful. Some people might prefer more bass though or more sparkly highs but for me the WF XM5s strike a perfect balance. Putting aside the marginal audio improvements, the big thing for me though was the new size. They're much smaller than the large bulbous WF XM4s and that was the big reason I was looking forward to these new ones. And I'm quite happy to report the size is definitely a welcome change. The WF XM4s would always start to wiggle loose in my ears after extended use and after a while, they almost get 'pushed' out of my ears unfortunately. Sony also added a new size to the ear tips, a 'SS' size (super small?). So it's L, M, S and....SS. The ear tips are made of new material and is supposed to enhance the sound quality. Meh, I don't hear much difference personally. The housing of the earphone is different too....more glossy not a matte finish like the WF XM4s. Not sure whether I like this or not but they do look different and I always like the color contrast of the gold Sony branding and gold mic with the black color housing. The ANC and call quality in my opinion still doesn't match some of my other earphones unfortunately. Still overall I'm quite happy with the new version, mainly because the sound quality hasn't diminished and they're much smaller. Looking forward to more software updates from Sony for the WF XM5s in the months to come...","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2023",AEMULWWDDSMT2YV3YEDIFBOXLSBQ,1,38,Color: Black,"July 30, 2023",2023-07-30,2023-07,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

Thought the Sennheisers were going to win, as I was upgrading from the TW2s. Nope. The audio and customization capabilities on the WF-1000XM5s were unbelievable. It's like you're standing in a room with the band you're listening to, and you're able to pick out each instrument, each overdub, and every single layered vocal. And with the app, you can dial it in even further. Fantastic.CONS:The stock silicone tips are both uncomfortable and a poor fit. I bought some aftermarket foam tips, and they're more comfortable. But this was where the STW4s won out -- they were like pillows in your ears. Even with the new ones, they still come loose more often than I'd like.The case is fine, but not befitting of $300 buds. There are aftermarket ""slip-on"" cases, but...come on, Sony. Even $30 earbuds offer digital readouts of the battery level on the cases. It's *almost* sturdy...but just flimsy enough to make me nervous. And getting the buds out could be easier.ANC: Wavers. Sometimes great, sometimes meh.COLOR: I tried the black and the silver versions. Black ones and the case are classy and slick.

The tap shortcuts don‚Äôt support all music apps, which can be limiting. Also, the touch controls being active during insertion can cause accidental activations. On the bright side, the earbuds offer excellent active noise cancellation and sound quality, largely due to the equalizer customization.

I have the WF and WH series going back to 1003 versions. I purchased these on day 1 mainly because my 1004s got wet and the case no longer holds a charge. For the first two months I was extremely disappointed - sound and ANC was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than the previous version. I know I have weirdly large ear canals and purchased my standard ear tip replacements but they just didn't work. None of the included ear tips worked - especially in my left ear. Eventually I just gave up and carried a separate battery backup for my 1004s.Recently I found a new ear tip vendor and purchased several options - memory foam, silicone, etc. I found that if I replaced the ear cup in the left ear with one in a smaller diameter but GREATER length it would fit well.With the fit finally sorted I started comparisons. Overall these are barely, marginally better than the previous version. It's not worth the extra cost, in my opinion. ANC has no noticable difference and overall sound response is basically unchanged with just a slight improvement in mid tone clarity.Get the 1004s and wait for the 1006s.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AHGMP46KJI7DQAEIVU4WQKBXARVQ,1,1,Color: Black,"November 30, 2023",2023-11-30,2023-11,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

R3L29RCDQOSFC5,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars A few questionable design decisions,George G,4.0,"The ANC, sound quality and battery life are all excellent. The fit is an improvement over the M4s (which I returned due to battery and connection issues). But I'm taking a star for a few questionable design decisions.First, the buds are quite slippery and difficult to remove from the case. I can see this being a problem after exercise or during rainy weather. Some matte texture would have helped. What's weird is that they make this smoothness a selling point in the marketing material. How much did they test these in the real world?Second, and possibly worse long term, the eartips have a mesh to prevent debris from getting into the buds, but that's it. There is no foam inside the buds. If you need replacement eartips in the future, you'll want to find tips that have mesh protection, but after a cursory search on Amazon I don't see many options with a mesh. Now maybe you're like me and happy with the included tips, but In my experience they will wear out. So unless Sony starts selling their own replacements, this was a bad decision.In general, it feels like two steps forward on fundamentals, one or two steps back on design even if they are more comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023",AGEEJ2HE7XACHRCI4ZNNJGNO66GQ,1,1,Color: Silver,"December 7, 2023",2023-12-07,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

You simply tilt each bud to the sides of the case, then lift them out. Simple.As much as I love these, they lost a star to one feature that is missing. The inability to program the button functions is frustrating. Four taps on the buds to adjust the volume?

The sound quality is very good, especially when I get a tight seal in my ears, which is not always easy. The LDAC codec does make a subtle difference in sound quality for the better. (Higher quality sound available on some Android decices.) My only complaint is that I would sometimes like them to be a bit louder than they are. My main genre of music is classic rock, hence wanting the sound a bit louder. I used the app to tweak the equalizer more to my liking.The active noise reduction (ANR) works quite well. I haven't had buds with ANR before, so I do not really have anything to compare it to, but they do a good job of drowning out most ambient sounds when engaged. I have not used them for more than about 3 hours at a time yet, so I can't comment on battery longevity.Would I buy them again? Good question. I probably would if the price dropped some. If not, I would probably try another brand that cost about the same as these and also supports the LDAC codec.","Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023",AFH3KQDERPJ65MKB5ISRTJXVDTGA,1,7,Color: Silver,"September 27, 2023",2023-09-27,2023-09,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

For a while, I've been seeking for the best/decent earbuds after my Pixel ones wore out. Multiple website reviews all directed me to these Sony WF-1000XM5. Thus, I purchased these earbuds and was greatly disappointed to some features/details that weren't mentioned on product pages or reviews:1) Degradable earbud tips - Yep, the ear pieces are super soft foam but biodegradable. I get the whole trying to limit waste in the environment, but if I'm spending $200+ on earbuds, I'd like for the material to last more than 6 months.2) Case felt like recycled hard foam - Same as above, for the price asked, it's just not right.3) Volume controls - This was the main thing that killed it for me. Gesture/Touch interface is terrible. To raise/lower volume, one must repeatedly tap the earbud four times, which only raises/lowers by one level. The app has options to change some gesture/touch but nothing for volume. It goes back to my previous nitpicks: If I'm spending way too much on headphones, I better be getting something near perfect.Sound on the earbuds were great, and the fit was the most comfortable I have felt in years. However, due to the three things mentioned above, the $250 pricetag was not worth it for me.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AEEUHYIY5VJRYOKSKSJPFSHR4D7Q,1,2,Color: Silver,"December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,2023-12,Sony,Sony WF-1000XM5 - Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

ANC is about 95% blocking out all other noise, the features are great in the app to configure them, and so far the battery life is stellar. However, the sound quality is the most impressive by far and large. I walk in the gym on treadmills and I can't hear a large fan blowing directly at my head nor could I hear people talking around me, but as far as the audio I can hear rich bass and highs so well that even in previously viewed youtube videos I was hearing things I couldn't before. I also use them while connected to my computer via bluetooth while flying in the sim in VR. These things are incredible!The only drawback I will say is that to adjust the volume you have to repeatedly tap on the left or right bud and sometimes if it doesn't register a tap you may end up having them do one of the quick functions. This isn't that big of a deal for me though as I adjust my volume from my phone or computer.Also, if one bud is out you lose the functions that bud provides. So if the left bud is out I cannot toggle ANC, and if the right bud is out I can't stop playback.

Sound quality is superior to any ear buds I have owned. I enjoy a little more base when listening to music so using the app I was able to get the sound set to my liking. Rechargeable carrying case is light and the battery life is good, though less than others but using the full Emersion sound accounts for some of this. In my opinion it‚Äôs worth the trade off. It‚Äôs great to ditch the giant headphones on planes and still get great noise canceling and sound quality.Cons:There are conflicts when connecting with other devices. My Powerbeats ear buds would allow two connections to both my iPad and iPhone and the ear buds would switch automatically depending on which I was using. Sadly the Bose earbuds don‚Äôt do this so I am constantly having to manually connect them when switching using the Bose App. Volume control, pause and skip are touchy and I find myself pausing the music accidentally or skipping to the next song. Powerbeats uses a physical button push which feels more interactive. I started using my phone to control volume, pause or skip songs but I found once I do this, the Bose earbud controls are over ridden and stop responding to attempts to control my media. I don‚Äôt use the pause button when attempting to have a conversation I just remove them. There is no way to add the Earbuds to the ‚ÄúFind my Device‚Äù App on IPhone and Bose does not have this feature. I misplaced them while on Vacation and learned quickly to always but them back in the case when not using them.I would still recommend them due to their superior noise canceling and sound quality.

With regular headphones I could barely hear my own music over the smack, smack, smack of jogger. First I cheaped out and bought the Soundcore A40 earbuds which came highly rated for the price. I liked the app and the options better than the Bose, but the Bose noise cancelling is much better. CONS: 1. The touchpad area on the Bose earbuds are way too sensitive. If I'm wearing a sunhat with a string that keeps the hat on, the earbuds turn on and off repeatedly when the string gets too close to the earbuds. If my long hair blows in the wind - the earbuds also construe it as a ""tap"" and turns off the music. Very annoying! 2. The Soundcore app had many more options for ""programming"" the earbuds - one tap vs. 2 taps, etc. so I was able to DISABLE the ""one tap"" option that stopped & started the music. Bose needs to add this option to their app, as there are very few options and most of them are related to what ""mode"" you want for noise cancelling (immersion, aware...etc.) .

These Bose Ultras are by far superior in almost every way. The only things I miss are app related. The Samsung app had a ""Find my buds"" tracker and these don't appear to have anything similar. Also, there were more preset eq options and I could see how much battery was left in the buds and the case just by glancing at my phone without opening the app.1. Volume - much louder, at half the volume. Nice!2. Sound - Love the immersion settings. No distortion when I adjusted the bass boost all the way up. Clear, warm, crisp and full. I'm a basshead so I could do with even more bass TBH. I want my head to rattle when I have the bass boosted. The ""Aware"" setting amplifies outside sound to the point where I COULD eavesdrop on conversations if I wanted. The ANC settings are almost scarily quiet. Not so funny story: While I was testing the ANC I actually didn't hear the my fire alarm go off after I deliberately tripped it for testing purposes. I think you would want to be super careful using the ANC on this set if you're running/walking outside as well, because you won't hear cars or other people or really anything except your choice of music. It will be perfect for flights or the noisy cafeteria at work though.3. Fit - right out of the box I have a perfect fit and seal and they are COMFORTABLE enough to wear for hours without any ear fatigue. The style of these just fit my ear. I struggled daily with the Samsung buds and tried several different brands of eartips with no success. The left one fell out constantly no matter what size and style of eartip I tried.4. App - this is where it falls short. The app isn't as intuitive as Samsung's or as loaded with options. If I misplace my earbuds there isn't a way to track them with a beeping sound or location.5. The look - these are just better looking all around, and the blue color is gorgeous.6. Battery life - not great when using immersion and quiet settings. A few hours max usage when fully charged. This is truly disappointing but they do fast charge, and I won't need ANC all the time so... it's not a deal breaker for me.7.

R2J2VUX3PY8PYC,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Red flags,DL,3.0,"I'm a professional musician and an earbud connoisseur...I live in New York City and depend on ANC earbuds for the subway, street, and listening to music and podcasts, etc... So I need very strong noise cancellation and pretty good detail in the sound (for actual editing and review I'd use a flat open ear set of cans, of course).These earbuds have a nice, warm sound and I guess I'm fortunate that they make a good seal in my particular ear opening so the ANC does the trick just about anywhere. The fit is snug so they don't fall out and I can wear them comfortably for a long time. Those are the positives.The negatives:‚Ä¢ The tap activation on the buds is waaaay too sensitive, so the simplest adjustment makes an action (starting, stopping play, activating assistant, and so on). Very annoying but even more annoying if you're on a call and go to adjust the bud and you inadvertently hang up.‚Ä¢ The Bluetooth is not intuitive at all and gets wonky. Often it won't connect to my iPhone on a call until I place them back in the charger and reset the thing. In the other direction, the other day my phone wouldn't pick up because the buds remained connected *even* after they were sitting in the case in another room!‚Ä¢ Taking calls on the street is an issue because these buds do very little to suppress the sound of wind. My AirPods Pro are fantastic at this--I ask people if they can hear the wind or sirens going by and they say either they barely hear it or not at all. Using these Bose on a slightly windy day the person I called had a lot of trouble hearing me.‚Ä¢ Having to buy an additional $50 charger for wireless charging is a suspect business practice when most all others at this price have it standard--not to mention it's wasteful. If I buy the wireless case, I may as well throw out the previous one‚Ä¢ The simple act of taking the buds out of the case is difficult, which again at this price point and state of engineering/design simply shouldn't be.TL;DR if you're an Apple user, these earbuds take the connectivity and charging issues of AirPods Pro and multiply them several times over. My APP have an occasional issue, but these new Bose have already had significant glitches. The sound might be a little better on the Bose, and the comfort is better too, but that's where it all ends.The Beats I've tried fit nicely but are lower quality across the board. The B&W P17s have good sound but are unwieldy and uninspired. The Creative Aurvana have great sound at half the price but none of the bells and whistles (worth checking out though)So yeah, three stars and unfortunately dropping...

I personally have NO issues. I know, its rare. I dont have any issue and these are paired to 8 devices. Macbooks, Air, Pros, iPhone, Ipad, no issues. No multipoint is a let down but come on, I got too many devices anyway. They just need to work on the firmware.Sound Quality: A+I mean Bose come on. These things are sick. I have the Ultra over the head, they sound amazing but these are even better. The Immersive audio I thought would be a gimmic, its not. They nailed this. Bass is stellar and so much fun. Every song sounds insane.Build: BListen the case is junk. It works but could be much better. Do I care? No. Earbuds build is great. No issues there.Microphone: B-Could be better for calls and I do have issues with them here randomly and sometimes completely fine. A firmware update would probably fix majority of issues.Fit: AI have no complaints they fit my ears and they are comfortable. I cant wear the other brand because they kill my ears.Overall: B+Their amazing. Could be an A if they would improve the firmware a bit but man if your using those other guys white things come on - your missing out on amazing sound quality.Bose - good job - just get the firmware dialed in and these are rockstars.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AEWB7O7TKBE74JQB6Z26ORZKU2UA,1,2,Color: White Smoke,"May 24, 2024",2024-05-24,2024-05,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
ROZRM8KBJVH9V,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best on the market! but‚Ä¶.,Amazon Customer,5.0,"So got these after doing a lot of research on Bluetooth earbuds. I normally use headphones and know earbud quality can be different too with brands. So I wanted to make sure I get the best, and with these you get the best. I did have a problem with them not even into a month (continue reading before assuming please like I almost did). One side of them stopped working and would just have a static noise. Saw this was a common problem with these headphones. Called customer support and they were super helpful. Would give me a brand new pair after returning mine. I did not get a chance to return them, but after a month decided to fully charge them and try them again. To my surprise they worked and then started disconnecting like every 10 minutes after that day. Looked at the censors and saw that a few of them were covered in hardened wax. Was super small so I could barely see it. Fully cleaned the earbuds and they were working perfectly fine. These headphones are the best because they are super sensitive. That have sensors all over the earbuds that detect your ears so you have to keep them clean otherwise you might think they are messed up like I did. ü§£ I digress though. Sound quality is the best and I have Beats Studio Pros and Beats Studio + buds.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2024",AF7CVF3FJJIK57R6KMS43SC4FIBQ,1,1,Color: White Smoke,"July 14, 2024",2024-07-14,2024-07,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R3J05OX8EWOYBR,B0CD2FSRDD,2.0 out of 5 stars For Audio & Music - Great! / For Phone Calls - Horrible!,SKova,2.0,"I used these on an iPhone 12 Pro Max. While I was tempted to get a new set of Echo Buds 2, I wanted to try the Bose QC Earbuds. With there being a $50 discount at the time, I went for it, even after reading some of the mixed reviews. Here is are the positives and the negatives.Positives:- These earbuds fit is fantastic. The supplied silicon ear pieces and ""wings"" made the fit simple and snug. I could wear them for extended periods and did not experience any pain. They are also very easy to insert into your ears with no problems.- Sounds quality for Audio Sources (except for Phone calls) is amazing. I was very happy with the sound quality and how balanced it sounds. If I was only to use them for listening to Music and Movies (connected to my TV to listen in private), I would keep them. Having compared to the AirPods Pro 2 that I have now, they were better. The APP2 lack some of the highs that were very clean in the Ultras.- The Aware and Quiet modes (ANC) work extremely well. The Echo Buds 2 had a very good ANC and the passthrough was pretty good. On the Bose, the Aware Mode is awesome and the Quiet Mode is fantastic. I could mow the lawn in Quiet Mode and really not hear the tractor.- The Battery Life is very good, they would last the published times without any problems.- Placing the earbuds in the case was very easy and they would not fall out. The magnets that pull them into place are very strong.- Switching between two phones was best accomplished just using the Bluetooth settings from the phone, not the Bose App as is reported to do.Negatives:- Phone Calls are by far the worst of anything that I have ever tried. This is the primary reason that I returned these just before writing this review. The volume for phone calls (only phone) is about 50% or less than the maximum volume of any other audio sources. In other reviews here and other forums, it is the most common complaint by far from all others. My first call was while outside walking and my party could not understand me very well and I could not hear them with Aware Mode or Quiet Mode. I tried a few other calls and they were all bad, with the last one where I needed to switch to the phone from the earbuds where I decided that these were being sent back. I even contacted Bose to see what they would say.- Connection only to one device at a time, is a disappointment. Almost all others support Multi-Point, this was a shortcoming. I did have trouble getting it to connect to an iPad Air 2, not sure if it is the older iPadOS or what. Never got back to solving that.- Case only supports USB-C for charging, not a deal breaker, you would think it would be part of a high-end product.- Support from Bose was very disappointing. I could not find a way to enter a support ticket on their website, was able to make contact through X with DM messages to their support team. They did not answer everything that I wrote and did not address the main issue correctly. I told them that I cannot hear other parties on a phone call, they twice sent me links about getting the microphone positioned better. Not hearing the other party, has nothing to do with the mic. They also sent me a link for over the ear headphones, which was not even the product that I have, they knew that too as they had the Serial Number and referenced what I had.I really wanted these to work, as I like all of my other Bose products. So disappointed that they could not acknowledge that there are reports of Phone Call issues and they are working on it. I might have waited.If you want them for audio, they are great. If you are going to make phone calls, you will most likely be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AEHL4ZYEE3VIP4E4EIPTOVJ64LNQ,1,0,Color: Black,"June 25, 2024",2024-06-25,2024-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

R1CAQMDLZ50UJT,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars 10 out of 10 noise cancelling, call quality is lacking",KP,4.0,"These earbuds are probably some of the best you can buy if you're looking for top quality noise cancelling. Turning on the active noise cancelling for the first time and hearing the background noise around you disappear is an experience. With noise cancelling on, you won't have to turn the volume up too loud since it mutes background noise so well. You also won't hear cars coming when you walk, or anyone walking up behind you, so keep safety in mind, the noise cancelling is that good!The sound quality on these is up to the quality you'd expect from Bose. There is a basic equalizer within the app (bass, mid, treble). There is also an immersive audio feature which makes it sound like you're in the middle of a stage with the audio expanded around you.The earbuds come with different sizes of rubber-like buds and ""wings"" that go around the unit to help stabilize them in your ear.I have a few complaints that make these earbuds a 4 out of 5 stars for me.First, the Bose app can be finicky, losing connection with the buds and it can be difficult to get them to reconnect.Second, the call quality is pretty atrocious for the person on the other end. Running water, crinkling bags, wind blowing, and any other background noise comes through so loudly on the other person's end that I've had multiple people complain and offer to call me back when I can talk on the phone instead of the earbuds. This is a well known problem that people have posted online about for years and somehow Bose has not fixed it. For $300 this shouldn't be an issue.Third, these should come with wireless charging. You can get the Bose wireless charging case for these for $50, making the total package for these $350. Again, for $300 I believe these should come with the ability to wirelessly charge without the need for another pricey accessory.All in all I absolutely recommend these despite the complaints, in fact I have a coworker who picked up a pair after I raved about mine.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AERYWWI5H6SDI3S7AWTETMXTKP5A,1,6,Color: Black,"April 21, 2024",2024-04-21,2024-04,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

They're more comfortable, the noise cancelation is better, and the bass is better.They are not more than three times as expensive better, though.They also have annoying problems.1.) The left earbud likes to make low volume high pitched bleeping noises, making it had to use them as just noise cancelling earplugs. I end up having to play white noise just to drown out the annoying noise.2.) The noise floor is high. Sitting there with nothing playing not connected to anything there's a definite low level white noise. Have you ever stood outside on a frigid winter day in the woods, when there's no wind and no animal noises? It's like that. It's not unpleasant but it's there.3.) Annoying connectivity problems with my Sony XBR-85X900F. Sometimes I have to turn the TV off and back on to get audio to play, even when it shows connected.4.) Lack of LEDs to display status on the earbuds. My $35 Chinese special earbuds have these for crying out loud.5.) They smelled weird out of the packaging, almost a moldy smell. It's still there even after having used them for a month. Not fun when you're shoving them in your ears.6.) Battery life is only OK, and with some of the sound options turned on becomes pretty bad.They do a good job at drowning out the incessant train noise, barking dogs abandoned to be bored in their back yards all day, and my annoying neighbors that all cut their mufflers off during the ""C"".The bass is strong, especially with bass boost turned on.Overall sound quality is good, if the volume of what you're listening to is high enough to drown out the high sound floor.Honestly though, you can get 80% of the performance of these for less than a third of the price. These are only worth buying if you have money to burn.

R1BC682J9YKP8L,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars What I wish I had known before buying,Emily,3.0,"I'll lay out the full story as briefly as possible, but this is what I wish I had known earlier.TL;DR: the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras are not as premium as they seem and the Sony Wf-1000xm5s just needed better tips to be absolutely perfect.I had the Sony Wf-1000xm4s and I loved them. Bad battery problem within a year so they were returned.Next I bought the Sony Wf-1000xm5s because ""upgrade"". I hated them because I didn't feel like they blocked out any noise. I could clearly hear others talking to me. This was with the included ear tips and the SpinFits I used on my xm4s. Decided to try something new.Finally the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras. I was so impressed that they don't really need to go in the ear to block out sound and as your environment changes, it adjusts a little here and there. I was blown away. HOWEVER, the Bose Music app is atrocious and the touch controls might as well not be there at all. To play my music I needed to start it on my phone first. With other earbuds I could tap to play whatever was last playing without touching my phone. Also, the response time on these was incredibly slow. I needed to wait a full 3-5 seconds before I could even tell if the tap actually registered on the buds so sometimes I'd pause and unpause my music on accident. It was horrible. Oh, also you can't disable touch controls on the Bose so sometimes it would pause my music because my hair or hat touched it... Very annoying.I did some research and it turns out the Sony Wf-1000xm5s are a little tricky and really require you to get just the right ear tips (I have teeny tiny ear canals but I hear people with other sizes had trouble too). Once I found the right tips through trial and error, they worked perfectly. Taps register immediately. The time it takes to play, pause, turn on ambient noise, etc. is nearly instant and it easily plays my music without touching my phone once. The other features are also fabulous but that's for a different review.I did extensive testing while I still had both buds, and I found out that while the Bose seemed like they blocked out more noise, they actually blocked, and failed to block, the exact same things the xm5s did. The only difference is the Bose created an ambient ""silence"" that tricked me into thinking it was blocking out more, but really it was just cancelling the sound of the blood in my own head. Granted that's neat, but if I want to block out chatter, shuffling noises, traffic, etc. they block out the exact same things (with a PROPER seal and correct tips on the xm5s).So besides that ambient silence and not needing to go all the way in my ear canal, the xm5s have the Bose beat in every way. I can't believe these cost more than the Sonys, given the terrible software and tap response.So to conclude, the Sony WF-1000xm5s are way better BUT you need to put in the effort to find the perfect tips for your ear shape. It's annoying, but you definitely won't regret saving some money and getting better features. I think I'd only prefer the Bose if touch control wasn't a factor or I had trouble putting things in my ears.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AHPUNTPILXEUVY7J3CB3YKKQT5GQ,1,17,Color: White Smoke,"February 1, 2024",2024-02-01,2024-02,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R1VT3M76LMYOQI,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow!,WarEagleX,5.0,"So, I just left my beloved Sony 1000XM5s on the plane and decided to try these out since the Sony's are ranked #1 and these are ranked #2. So this is a Sony vs Bose review.1) The first thing I noticed when putting these on is how much less pressure and weight are on their ear and ear canal. The weight is distributed so these disappear and you forget you're wearing them. I liked the Sony's in-ear design since they are less visible and I wasn't sure what I felt about Bose's style, but having them in - I like them, they're sleek and sexy.2) The Bose app is much better looking than the Sony app. Yes the Sony has more functions but the app is like something from the 1990s while the Bose app is sleak simple and useful. Also, the Bose app tells me the airbuds are charging when not in ear while the Sony app just says disconnected and that's that.3) The Sony case is smaller and sleaker but the 1000XM5's new plastic is slippery. They get oil from your skin which makes taking them out of the case quite interesting. The Bose is much easier to grip and remove out of the case. Unfortunately, the Bose case does not have wireless charging which is a shame.4) Bose's noise canceling is superior to Sony's - as you would expect for anything bearing the QuietComfort logo. Because they are so light on the ears and the silence you create, you forget that you're not simply in a quiet room. It's a big win for a road warrior like me who's on a plane every week.5) The music sound stage vs Sony is a matter of taste. I listen to EDM so the soundstage and bass is magnificent on the Bose. I listed to my playlist on these and got goosebumps. It was like hearing many of the songs for the first time - especially in immersion mode. The Sony's were also excellent, but the Bose seems like it is more ""professional,"" if that makes sense.6) Battery life. Yeah, so if you use immersion mode, you have a horrific 2 hours of battery life. That's barely any good for a short flight. I would imagine about a 4 - 5 hour life on the Bose. But then again, I only got about 4 1/2 hours of life on the 1000XM5. So as long as I can get music for most of a transcon flight I'm okay. I don't mind charging 20 minutes for another 2 hours.So the verdict - I have to say I think the Bose Ultra is the best NC earbud, squeezing out a win over the excellent Sony 1000XM5.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AHSAHFTGP7YDX74AZA7U3HYGQN5Q,1,11,Color: Black,"March 22, 2024",2024-03-22,2024-03,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
RJJPQB51VQDF1,B0CD2FSRDD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Full review! Overall, highly recommend!",Shelley B,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. Since the Bose noise canceling earbuds are so expensive, I felt that it was important to do a full review. I have a neurological disorder that requires me to be able to control the sound in my environment. One of the requirements is noise canceling. It is important to note, that these are not 100% noise canceling. That being said, there is a quiet mode that does an amazing job of blocking out a large majority of volume. It worked so well that I didn‚Äôt even hear if my car was running. There are some other fantastic features on here. I tried to put some screenshots so you could see what the app looks like. One of the great features is the ability to control the amount of base and travel you are able to hear. In my case, the base to the lowest level was important. You can also set various modes as your favorites. And then you can even set it up to remember the last mode you set the earbuds to.Another great feature, as you are able to scroll through the various modes that you have starred as your favorites, by just touching and holding which ever earbud you want to use as your shortcut. In my case, I actually set it up for both so I didn‚Äôt have to remember.The immersive sound feature is great for those who are really looking for any more natural listening experience. It‚Äôs not one that I found useful, but I know that someone else might.The other mode that I have used is the aware mode. This is for when I‚Äôm in a situation where I really kind of need to hear what‚Äôs going on around me, but do not want the volume to be at its full level.Obviously, the brand speaks for itself when it comes to quality of sound. Whether I am listening to an audiobook, or on a phone call, this sound is what you would expect from Bose.As for comfort, the one negative is that they are rather large in size, but they do offer flexibility in creating a comfort fit that is right for you. It took some time for me to figure out which size adapters felt the best for me so play around with that. Even though the size is larger than I would have liked, the overall quality and Sound reduction is worth it to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AEQZ45LZM5AC4WOLSJHGA4MS7V3A,1,7,Color: White Smoke,"June 2, 2024",2024-06-02,2024-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R2Y1T8BV9EOOPM,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars BOSE: Does not dissapoint,Gabe,5.0,"Over the course of the last several years, I have had several different types of headphones. My job allows me the time to listen to anything while I work. I started with some Bose Quiet Comfort several years back (which i still have and they work fine). Bass and clarity on the Bose QC is phenomenal, but using it for calls was a bit of a problem because the clarity on the microphone was a bit lacking, but for music and everything else, amazing. I decided to try a pair of Beats Studio 3's which were also amazing, a bit better when making calls and had a little more loudness than the BQC's. I stuck with those for several years, a pair stopped working, I bought another pair and still have those and have another brand new pair in reserve that I got at a good price...just in case. I tried a pair of AKG in ear headphones that were good. I tried some Samsung buds which were decent but less bass than I liked, which the AKG possessed. This past Christmas I decided to try the Beats Buds and they were better than both the AKG and the Samsung buds, in volume, clarity, and bass. I like a lot of bass in my music and the Beats buds seem to work well and the bass was good. Still, always felt there there may be better out there either way...even as good as these Beats were.There was.I bought these Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras to see if THESE could be ""that better"" that I was searching. They were more than better. The sound quality is off the charts, with the app you can adjust the bass and it is mind blowing. I was working and I could hear the buzz of the air conditioner, but when I put on these headphones: silence. I thought the AC turned off by chance, right when I put the headphones on...I took them out...and all i could hear was the AC. These headphones silenced everything around me, all I could hear was my breathing. I was in shock. I still am. The music quality is unlike any headphones I have had. I've only used them for 3 days, but my God, Bose really is on another level. I will see how these last but if these first 3 days are any indication, I am sure I will be in heaven for as long as I have these. I haven't really messed with the app yet, but I am sure that it will make these headphones even better.If you are wondering if there is anything better out there like I did: There is. Give these a try...its Bose.

R1NKXX3175EXHL,B0CD2FSRDD,1.0 out of 5 stars When will I learn my lesson that Bose is not for me?,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I'm on a never-ending quest for good noise-cancelling earbuds. I work from home and need to block out the incesscent noise from neighborhood leaf blowers and the creepy ice cream truck that loops through our neighborhood every day. But I also need to focus and can't stand music that's too loud, so I need the volume to be able to adjust very low. I'd prefer more than 8 hours of listening time but I know that's a stretch for earbuds with good ANC.So far, the two best pairs I've found for my purposes are the Sony LinkBuds S and the Soundcore by Anker Liberty 3 Pro. The Edifier TWS1 PRO and Soundcore by Anker Space A40 have also not been too bad, although the ANC and the volume reduction is not where I need them to be. I also use an older pair of Apple airpods with my Apple devices. They're probably the most comfortable but the noise-cancelling and volume reduction isn't good enough for my needs.Most days, I switch betwen the Sony pair and the Liberty 3. The Sonys fit so well. They're comfortable. The sound is great. The noise cancelling is pretty good, some leaf blower noise sometimes creeps in. The Liberty 3s are a little bulky but the sound is good and the volume reduction is the best out of all the many earbuds I've tried. The noise-cancelling is good but not great. Those pesky high notes from the ice cream always slip in and the drone of leafblowers in the background is usually still present, although they bring it down to a tolerable level.Now that it's Spring, the windows are open and the leafblowers are out, I got in my head that I needed to resume my quest for the perfect earbuds. In case the technology has magically improved so much in the last two years, I guess. Everything I've read online names the Bose QuietComfort Ultra as the best for noise-cancelling and sound. Well, I've had Bose headphones in the past and was seriously underwhelmed. Not being able to lower the volume low enough to focus and work was my biggest complaint. For just listening to music for fun, they're great but I need my earbuds/headphones as a work tool. Not only does the volume not lower enough, when I'm not thinking about it and try to lower the volume a click and they're already at their lowest setting, they give you this obnoxious, jarring ""bong"" noise that scares the crap out of me. I never figured out how to get rid of that so my headphones have been collecting dust for the last four years. Since it's been a while and everyone still raves about Bose, I thought maybe they've improved.NOPE. These QuietComfort Ultra buds are so insanely loud, even on the lowest setting. Even dropping the EQ to -10 across the board doesn't help. The immersive audio is actually nice. I like it. Again, if I only wanted to listen and enjoy music, they sound great. Well, except for the ANC. The ANC is so loud and fuzzy, I feel like a dog with my head hanging out of the window with these in. Seriously? THIS fuzzy static is the exceptional noise-cancelling people rave about? My $79 Liberty 3 Pros don't sound like I'm going through a wind tunnel, why do the $300 Bose? As I'm sitting here typing this, I just caught the high tinkling notes of the ice cream truck too. It definitely blocks more of that annoying jingle than any other buds I've tried but...that's about the only thing it excels at.I'm not an audiophile by any means, so I'm sure I'm not using the right technical terms. I have noise-sensitivity issues (obviously) and I need to have long periods of extreme concentration while I'm working. I have like three things I want a pair of earbuds to do. Block out irritating, rage-inducing noises, play music at an extremely low volume, and be comfortable. Maybe that's too much to ask? I've tried a few different price points and can not quite find exactly what I need. I feel duped by all the people who review Bose with such glowing praise, that has just not been my experience with any of their products (I have one of their speakers too that's just meh.)Will I have learned my lesson, that Bose is not for me? Only time will tell. I wish Amazon still allowed people to comment on reviews, becuase I'd love to know if any more experienced audio lovers have some suggestions for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AFZKLW6LMGR3THTDJQPE3L25FU5A,1,14,Color: Moonstone Blue,"May 17, 2024",2024-05-17,2024-05,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R38LAW536J73LT,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive earbuds, but case seems flimsy",Amazon Customer,4.0,"FEB 5, 2024 UPDATE: I've had these earbuds now for a few months and can say without a doubt they are superior to the AirPod Pro Gen 2. In fact, it's gotten to where I rarely use the AirPods any more and use the Bose earbuds almost exclusively. For the noise cancellation (which is why I purchased these), I'd give the Bose earbuds an 8 out of 10 and I'd give the AirPods a 7 out of 10. And for the actual audio quality, I'd give the Bose earbuds a 9 out of 10 and the AirPods would probably get an 8 out of 10. The thing that puts the Bose earbuds over the top with the audio quality is the ability to change the EQ via the app; you can't do anything like that out of the box with the AirPods.If I were someone debating on buying these Bose earbuds vs. AirPod Pro Gen 2, I'd definitely suggest purchasing the Bose earbuds. But one of my first complaints about the Bose earbuds is still a concern. The charging case is just so dang flimsy. Luckily, I haven't dropped it yet but it would probably only take that one drop to mess it up. I can't exaggerate or stress this enough how fragile it is. But, that's probably why Bose sells the individual charging cases on their website for $100; they're counting on it to break.ORIGINAL REVIEW (Dec 11, 2023): I also own Apple AirPod Pro's 2nd Gen but was looking for something with slightly better noise cancellation. The Bose earbuds succeeded there, just by a little. I haven't tinkered with the EQ settings much in the Bose app, but I have noticed that the AirPod's sound a little better (at least right out of the box). Another thing is that these earbuds fit rather well. It didn't take too much effort to get a comfortable and secure fit. However, my biggest complaint so far is that the case feels flimsy and cheap. I know the case isn't why we're using earbuds, but just figured I'd point it out to everyone, especially the klutz's out there. Drop this case on pavement or concrete a few times and I wouldn't be surprised at all if it breaks.Getting back to my comparison between these and AirPod Pro's... Right now, I'd have to say it's a bit of a draw between the two.","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2023",AE57FS42G3I6GRQZMLTQFND3RRUA,1,2,Color: White Smoke,"December 11, 2023",2023-12-11,2023-12,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R1LN0JEQB2AFGR,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Best out there, but some concerns",Mark Baum,4.0,"I owned some traditional Bose noise canceling headphones for years that I've used extensively for travel, mowing the lawn, etcetera. They're great! I was looking for something I could use every day, and because of my experience with the brand I purchased Bose QC Ultra Earbuds.Starting with the unboxing - Bose did a nice job with packaging, but you'd expect that in this price range. The earbud charger case is a nice shape and size, but it lacks wireless charging. This is disappointing for these high-end earbuds. The next thing I tried was removing the earbuds from the case. This is where I began to get annoyed. Perhaps there‚Äôs a trick I‚Äôm not aware of but getting the earbuds out of the case is much more difficult than it should be!The Earbuds themselves are very nice. After trying them for fit, I realized I needed to go to the larger Eartips and Stability Bands. Bose did a nice job in their manual stepping you through checking the fit and the replacement of these pieces. Once I replaced them, the earbuds are not falling out. This is especially important to me as these will mostly be used while riding my bicycle.I had already loaded the app and the earbuds connected without any fiddling on my part which was nice. I put on some of my favorite tunes and began testing the different settings; Noise Cancellation, Immersive Audio and Listening Modes. All were impressive, and each will have a place depending on the situation. Very nice!I realize this is a review of the earbuds, but the app is an important tool while using them. For example, there‚Äôs the ability to customize different combinations of the settings and setting them as favorites for quicker access. There‚Äôs also the ability to modify the default touch settings. I haven‚Äôt done this yet because I plan on living with the defaults for a while to see what might be lacking for me.Generally the app and connection is rock solid, but there was an instance where the earbuds kept loosing connection. An uninstall and reinstall of the app seemed to cure this.All in all I am happy with this purchase. Time will tell if the quality matches my original Bose headphones, but I am optomistic on that front. The only negatives I've found to date are the design of the case when extracting the earbuds, and the fact that the case doesn't include wireless charging.Hope this helped!","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AGWEER7MRNEHUTBKPVMROIOLZN7Q,1,13,Color: Black,"November 27, 2023",2023-11-27,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

R1FZJEA9SC5QU1,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars NEVER AGAIN! - I'm so annoyed with Bose,Amazon Customer,3.0,"UPDATE 7/2/2024:I am officially finished with Bose. These earbuds WILL NOT hold a charge when stored in the case. The case has never been over charged. Every single time I want to use the damn things, after I know they should be charged, they say ""battery low"". I officially finally hate them. The annoying, loud low battery warning a few hours after falling asleep with them in was enough on its own.I got these for $249 on sale in late 2023. Good, but Bose made bad choices.I waited for a very long time before getting these, due to price. I read many reviews first. I've noticed an audible faint hissing sound with the ANC. That's already kind of a bummer, but they do seal well and the active nose cancelling (ANC) works well. It's designed for constant, consistent noise rather than sudden unpredictable noise sounds (like my car travel mate's blasting 90's rock).FYI - NO ""noise cancelling"" products of any kind seem to actually fully block out car stereo when traveling as a passenger.Battery doesn't last all night to help reduce insomnia by listening to music or white noise to block out disturbances. Instead, these wake you up at 3am SAYING ""low battery"" instead of just auto shutting off, going on auto standby, or quietly just turning off. I hate electronics that talk, and I'm taking away stars for that, and may even return these due to it. People buy these precisely to NOT BE DISTURBED lol. I really wanted to rate only 2 stars because of how annoying that is, when you already deal with insomnia, but I know not everyone's the same. So 3 or 4 stars is the best I can give.I opted for these over the Sony's because I read these stay in ears better, and had glowing reviews. I'm not willing to risk losing an earpiece worth $300 because it wasn't designed to stay in place very well. No matter other issues I may have with these, at least they stay in and sound great.The case, unlike the Sony's version I read about, does not have wireless charging capability (bad choice by Bose) and they charge more slowly, I believe, without the ""fast charging"". Supposedly Bose makes a $50 additional accessory for this (which cancels the savings of buying these on sale $50 off), but when I went to look at it, it had bad reviews of what seemed like genuine customers lamenting the high price and bad quality of it. So I got a cheap silicone case cover instead, just to protect it and still don't have wireless charging.Anyway, aside from these few gripes, the sound quality produced is excellent. Very immersive. I'm not a big fan of touch controls on something so small, though. Adjusting position or hair etc, or a pet can easily end a call or change the song or volume accidentally and unpredictably. They do sit well in the ears and stay put pretty well. I only even considered this small form due to portability, but I absolutely do not approve of how small these are and how easy to drop from hand, at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEOCDBTNK2A4IAM3SKMWMLKNWNFQ,1,20,Color: Black,"December 30, 2023",2023-12-30,2023-12,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

I have all 4 of these now, and I am just blown away with the ANC of these. I really did not expect this. and the immersion setting is next level. QC Ultra wireless is now my go to and not headphones any longer.WHAT I LIKE:as far as fit and wear, I don't get the pressure build up and the bands do an excellent seal.Bass is to be respected. it's a full sound experience. it's deep and sound like it has alot of headroom at low and medium volumes.I just redid my home audio and installed Dolby atoms for that 3D sound in a 5.2.4 setup. this Immersion sound in the QC ultra, aka spatial sound, is game changer and puts atoms 3D sound to shame...[on music]. I listen to all types of music in this and it's giving me details I have never heard in listening to music, especially loft or lo-fi music to brain out at work and concentrate on worksheets and lines of code. I find myself just stopping what I'm doing and really listening to the music because I'm hearing elements I've missed and just go wow. When listening to movies, for the short time I had it attached to my fire tv cube, immersion kinda messed with tint of voice.the way the single ear wear auto adjusts to let more ambient noise in when the other earbud is out of ear is a very cool feature and welcomed. talking the same but this is not new, but does it well.ANC is Bose quality and beats my wh-1000xm4 headphones. I'll follow back up on this after my upcoming 17hr flight to Japan.touch controls work well. easy not too many touch combos to learn and remember.phone calls have been no complaints so far. i need more extensive testing of windy, noisy, car, etc. environments and will follow back up on this in next couple of weeks.WHAT COULD BE IMRPOVEDpairing to multiple devices have has hiccups and when pairing to a fire cube latest gen it completely lost pairing to my phones app (odd) and i just removed the fire cube once i repaired it. hopefully this gets fix in fw update.when taking out the left earbud from the case, it was almost drained, but it was in there overnight on a fully charged case. i think it didn't sit right and it does have some room to move around. i reposited it and it started charging.the earbuds are a PITA to remove from the case with thick hands. seriously Bose, take a look at this design. also putting them back in does not light up and ""suck in"" like a cradle magnet should do.when not listening to anything, the ANC does have some white noise. not too bad, but def could be improved on.OVERALL:you won't regret it. for close out of 23' these are the best. really great purchase, a bit $$$, but no serious complaints and better than my collection and daily driver.

The sound is phenomenal no doubt but I'm getting the same rather high pitched screeching on just the left bud as others have mentioned.

They died after two years of heavy use on airplanes and jobsites (dust!).Pros: - the noise cancelling is even better, really impressive - in-ear ergonomics are a little better - the case is smaller...Cons: - the earbuds run out of battery faster, and seem to take a charge from the case slower - the case seems to have much less capacity than prior Bose earbuds - you can't tell if the case is charged or not, so you never know if you have battery to last a long flight - damn near impossible to get out of the case when your fingers are oily or slippery - if you drop the case it pops open and shoots the earbuds gos knows where 100% of the timeSo, while the noise cancelling is excellent and the sound quality is Bose, I have pulled them out to find them low or put of battery more times than I can count. Funny thing, if they're dead they don't work and all the noise cancelling tech superiority in the world is worthless. Also, I'm constantly dropping them trying to get them out of the case. I feel like it is just a matter of time before they break because some designer never bothered to ask if they should be easy to get out of the case. And, while trying to get them out, I end up dropping the case and poof - I'm searching for them under seats or in a pile of dirt. Never had this issue with the old ones.

RQ56U4JBT275X,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Wow ! I learned a huge lesson with this purchase,C and E hyb,4.0,"First off, I have owned many many Bose products and have always been a fan. I did buy the over ear Sony WXM4 over the Bose offerings ( ie‚Ä¶700) quite simply because they were just better all around and the sound was off the charts. This time around I bought the open ear Bose buds first thinking they Seoul be that much more comfortable. Comfortable, they were, but the sound was just not even close to what I expected. I then bought the Bose QC ultra buds because they had noise cancelling and the fit looked like it would avoid going inside my ear and still get the necessary seal for good Noise Cancellation and sound. I value comfort very very much and in the ear canal buds just always disappoint me. After about 5 minutes of awesome music and NC, he discomfort is more than I wish to endure. Back to my purchase here. These earbuds are the single most perfectly fitting and comfortable buds I have ever used. I could easily wear them for a full 24 hours and not even know it. The sound is very good ( much much better than the open buds) but after I started tinkering with EQ to see if I can get better sound on par with my Sony over the ear, I realized it just wasn‚Äôt going to happen. The sound with these is fantastic and noise cancelation is awesome. The comfort is best ever. To get this comfort, you do sacrifice a bit of sound quality I am afraid. Having said that, I am absolutely choosing not to even try the Sony XM5 buds because I know they will sound a bit better but at the cost of major comfort sacrifice. I am sticking with my QC ultras.

R18L366K0CJGH0,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Not a good AirPods Pro Alternative,Robert,3.0,"I keep trying to move off the Apple everything bandwagon and get frustrated that the alternative product doesn't work nearly as well. Pros using the Ultras instead of the Airpod Pros: Super comfortable, excellent fit. Phenomenal noise cancellation. The Airpod Pros come close with the noise cancellation, however, just not as comfortable. Better bass, better sound. Especially watching movies. Cons: Horrible connection problems. The Ultras drop and reconnect frequently, even while on a call. Callers can't hear me sometimes even though I hear them just fine. Ultras won't connect to another device when I need to answer a call. I have to forget the Ultras and reconnect at least once a week on multiple devices to get it working. Bluetooth says it is connected even though I hear nothing. Outside noise cancellation on a call is horrible. Nobody can hear me when I'm talking outside or driving my utility vehicle on the highway. Frequently, one bud will drop and try to reconnect. Frequently, only one bud will cancel the noise and the other will not, causing me to pull both buds out, replace them in the case, drop the Bluetooth connection and try to reconnect, having to do this several times, sometimes just giving up altogether and grabbing my AirPod Pros. The Ultras are easy to drop when you pull them out of the case. There's no easy grip so you'll use the tip of your fingers to pull them out and readjust your fingers to put them in your ears. If you're driving while doing this, you're sure to drop one and good luck grabbing the black earbud on the dark floor of a car when driving down the highway. I find myself giving up on the Ultras and grabbing my AirPod Pros more and more just because I know they will work every time with just slightly inferior sound quality and slightly inferior noise cancellation. The AirPod Pros have none of the Ultra's problems for me.

Since that is their primary purpose, i give 4 out of 5 stars. It would have been 5 except the propeller heads in engineering and who wrote the mandatory app lack some common sense.1) These are very hard to get out of the case. Just a place to allow my fingers to grab the buds would help, since they are also very slippery. Its like they tried to have the smallest case and forgot the functionality. I have taken to looping a small rubber band around each bud to act as a lanyard. For this money, it should not be necessary.2) The case is very slippery. It‚Äôs like they had a ‚Äúslipperiest plastic‚Äù contest when they chose the material. So i bought a silicone case cover for the inevitable drop on the floor.3) One cannot turn off touch controls , a la samsung. Thus you trigger actions on your phone when merely touching the buds to adjust the fit, etc. . I am constantly triggering songs and podcast restarts just by trying to push the buds in tighter. I can push the buttons on the phone instead.4) The case hinge is lightweight and closes tenuously at best. Another rubber band needed to hold it shut.5) The app is WAYYYY slower with these buds than it ever was with my prior bose qc buds. Over time, the app should get better, not worse.6) When you switch noise cancelling modes, you have to tap and hold until the change occurs. As others have said, there needs to be some indication when you have succeeded in switching modes. Instead, you end up going one mode too far or not at all because the response (rightly) lags a little.7) No wireless charging. Really?

R1H3D43QM4MOQ4,B0CD2FSRDD,"3.0 out of 5 stars The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds - A good set, but not at the price",Susan A. Dunlap,3.0,"I was looking for some new earbuds to take with me on casual walks and for engaging in general listening sessions to relax. I've been a fan of Bose products for a while now and was eager to give these earbuds a try shortly after their release as my original Bose QC earbuds recently broke after two years of use. My review will be broken down into three categories: Features and Function, Comfort, and Sound and Battery Life.Features and Function - these earbuds need to be registered to a valid Bose customer account to be properly used. I have no problem with it as I currently own one other Bose product. However, I have noticed that there were times I could not properly access the headphones in the Bose Music App when I was engaged in my music. This more commonly occurred after around 45 minutes of continuous listening. I've also noted times when the earbuds were not in perfect sync with one another, and I've had to take them in and out at times to readjust them to my ears. However, the app does allow you to modify your preferred EQ (albeit a simplified one) and touch control settings, toggle immersion mode, and provide a way to check whether a proper ear seal has been achieved for both buds to help optimize your listening experience. Where Bose was potentially greedy here was the decision not to provide the included case with a wireless charging capability (they now offer a case with this feature for $50 extra). The call quality on these is decent, but nothing noteworthy compared to the competition.Comfort - By far, the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tested. The earbuds are relatively light, which helped them stay in my ears. I experienced no listening fatigue while wearing them with ANC on. On the note of ANC, these are also exceptionally great at isolating lower frequencies and could very well be among the best the market has to currently offer as other reviews might attest.Sound and Battery Life - This is in part where the earbuds fell short of my expectations. If you are prioritizing sound quality over ANC use, it might be more preferrable to look elsewhere. In this generation, the QC Ultras offers an immersion setting with two modes that provide uniquely different experiences, and turning this setting on does improve the sound quality incrementally at the cost of around 2 hours of battery life assuming this setting remains on for one full cycle. Even in adjusting the provided EQ, there were times that I felt the sound was a little off on the highs, but they do a good job on the mid-range tones and have a desirable the bass response (this is where the sound improvement, compared to the original QCs, was most notable).Now to the big question - are they worth the $300 price tag? In short, probably not. In summary, they have a good (not great) sound, exquisite comfort and ANC capabilities, and a simple set of settings that can be modified via the Bose Music App, but do not provide other features such as wireless charging for the included case that you might expect at this price point. Placing these earbuds at 3 stars is the best I can do for the time being, and I hope this motivates Bose to do a little better when they come out with their next set of earbuds. These were returned.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AEWD5BBOB5BS5PJCXKN6NRXSOIQQ,1,14,Color: Black,"November 5, 2023",2023-11-05,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

A little config with the Bose app EQ as well as on my phone and they sound pretty amazing, given what they are. I tried to use them over a company ZOOM call, I usually use my Apple AirPod Gen 2's for that, but they had a hard time connecting at first and then were fine. My only grief with the BQCU's is there is no way to mute a call other than from your phone. I called into BOSE customer service and they confirmed there was no way to mute a call.Update:I have been listening to these for most of the day. I can say with all of the putzing with eq's and different music, I'd say they sound a bit ""boomy"" - bass forward. The external sound dampening I am sure crates this as well as the crossover settings to make up for a small driver. One thing I noticed is when I am listening to bass heavy music, heavy metal, the driver seems like it created a vacuum in my ear and I could feel pressure on my left ear drum. I pulled the left one out, reinserted it and it didn't happen again. Yet. Overall, I'd say the audio quality is a 7/10 - given what they are, ANC earbuds. They do sound more ""natural"" when you have the Aware setting on so you can hear external noises, but then that won't work so well on plane/bus/train. Just my $0.02Update 2.0:I purchased the Apple AirPod Pro Gen 2. Listened to them with multiple options. Different kinds of music, phone calls, and noise canceling. I do like that the Airpods are lighter and I do like that they have this active noise canceling feature that cuts the notice canceling when you are speaking. Yes, you can it turns off, but I could see it being a thing for those that sing along. Overall, I would have to say, for my listening preferences (mostly metal and action movies) I prefer the Bose. I also like that you can customize the in-ear as well as the outer stability ring. I have found that in-ear pods don't stay in very long without them and I also have the Apple AirPods Gen 2 and if I move my head at all, they just fall out of my ear, quite easily in fact. So that's refreshing to have on the BQCU's. I have an older pair of QC over-the-ear headphones, and these earbuds sound better than those do!So in conclusion, I'll be sending the AirPods Gen 2 back. I did give them a shot but for how I hear, I prefer the Bose QC Ultra's. Hope that helps anyone looking.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AHPCLTW4VVI5ENFS2COV6OACD2RQ,1,19,Color: White Smoke,"October 18, 2023",2023-10-18,2023-10,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

The noise is unbearable with hundreds of employees there. With these on it sounds like people whispering across the room. My coworkers were impressed when they tried them as well.They're the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. They barely go into the ear. My last earbuds were Sony WF-1000XM4 and they felt like they touched my brain they went so far into the ear. They also somehow stay in better than the Sony's.The sound quality is a let down. It's no where near as good as the Sonys but everything else I like doesn't make me care.The UI/electronic side is sometimes buggy. I'm on android so it may be this. Sometimes they just don't connect, only one connects. Sometimes the noise cancellation doesn't turn on and it's stuck in passive mode that's way too loud. These problems sometimes happen, not consistently. They're significantly less buggy than the Sonys though.Phone call quality is terrible for sound quality and for the one on the other side of the call.Battery life is amazing.I'm glad I bought them but with the less than great sound quality these probably should have been $200 not $300.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGYRTFUK7NXSIJJ5PNZU3XCXJS5Q,1,0,Color: Black,"June 25, 2024",2024-06-25,2024-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

But I am particular about how technology works and I hate a few things about this. 1, the earbugs are super sensitive and if you touch it at all, even unintentionally, the music will stop and it's not clear how to resume without going through your phone. 2, sometimes the earbuds won't connect to your phone and you have to put them back in the charger for a minute and try again. This means if you are ever out without the charger, the earbuds can just never connect to your phone and you can't listen to any music.

With the earbuds in the case and case open you need to press the button on the back and the music app instantly recognizes the earbuds.Pros:1) Immersive sound is amazing in Still mode as it gives you a feeling of being in a live concert. When you move your head the sound stays in the same location. It feels like no sound is coming from the earbuds and the sound is coming from all around you.2) Noice Cancellation is excellent. There is an option to put it in aware mode if you want to hear the surrounding or off.3) You can control bass and treble however the out of the box sound was excellent and didn‚Äôt change anything.4) There are multiple eartips options for any size and shape of ear however for me the out of the box medium size was perfect. You can test whether the earbuds are the right fit from the Bose music app and it plays a test sound to check whether there is any audio leakage.5) You can group the Bose Soundbar with the earbuds and can hear the TV audio in your ears and turn the soundbar volume down. This way you can watch TV with sound muted and sound in your earbuds.6) The option to use one or both earbuds is fantastic and music pauses automatically when the earbuds are taken off. Also the controls on the earbuds are easy to use and very responsive. Tap to pause/play, double tap to move to the next song, three taps to go to the previous song, Swipe up and down for volume control and press and hold to change the mode or configure it for something else, using Bose Music App, like enabling Google assistant.7) Since it comes with charging case the earbuds are always 100% charged when in use. Just make sure that you charge the case when the LED color changes to amber.8) I made some test calls and the person at the receiving end didn‚Äôt feel a difference between direct call and earbuds. Also I could hear the voice very clearly while walking. To pickup phone call tap once and to end or decline a call double tap on the earbuds.What I wish for:1) It only supports Bluetooth connectivity and I wish there was an option to support sound over wifi (DLNA). For example if I could cast the song from my laptop to earbuds so that I am not restricted to Bluetooth range and can be anywhere in the house.2) Since its Bluetooth the earbuds are not always available in the music app and it takes a few seconds for the app to search for the earbuds and connect before you can use app to control it. Sometimes its not able to find it and you need to follow the same process as initial setup (keeping the earbuds in the case with case open and press the button on the back).","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AGURXMD5HAZLH4GMSMPTCEOPF4IQ,1,14,Color: Black,"October 13, 2023",2023-10-13,2023-10,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

I took the plunge on the newest product they had and the sound quality is out of this world specially in immersive with active noise canceling active. It‚Äôs literally you and your choice of music. I was hesitant about the duration of use coming from a unit that would function nonstop for 10 hour but after seeing the case was also a charging port it made things easier to use and charge faster. What does bother me is the fact that even with the alternate sizing pieces the earbuds still don‚Äôt feel as if they want to stay in my ears and that they can easily fall out. The ear tip system on the QuietComfort ear buds and QC 30 would have been a much better option for these as the flange area fits and stays in place much better over the ones that come with the QC ultra 2.

R14URZ1KDLMBI2,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound needing Functionality Help,Chris,4.0,"I would say that these are by far some of the best sounding headphone I‚Äôve ever used. The noise cancellation is on point, and the different modes are immersive. They may be meant for a great musical experience, but I found podcasts and calls equally enjoyable. These buds may seem bulky at first, but the fit is perfect and they are very light, I very rarely had to make any sort of physical adjustments. Battery life has also been a huge plus, both for the buds, and the recharge on the case. There is a drawback when it comes to connecting to a PC. There is no app to control the functionality as there is with a mobile device. So, you default to the same sound mode, giving you a special audio feeling. Not so great when doing video conference calls and trying to key in on the spoken word. There is also no feedback when you touch the headphone to change settings, even a subtle beep would let the user know that something has changed. There were a few times where I had accidental touches and did not notice because there of a lack of notification or messed up even further by overcorrecting with more touches. The case, though sleek, does not have a great finish. I do not know how many times I dropped it because of how slick it is. I have yet to find an attractive or well-fitting solution for this, in forms of a cover. Having used mostly mobile phone OEM buds in the past, my experience working out, doing work items on my PC, flying in planes, all talks I‚Äôve done with these Bose, seemed to be a bit less seamless. I gave myself adjustment time, but aside from the amazing sound, I‚Äôm finding this a downgrade to my daily routines. I shouldn‚Äôt have to think about audio modes multiple times a day, or fight with connections between multiple devices (moving from the wrong connection on the fly), or having them lose Bluetooth connection, and giving me consistent tones the one time I don‚Äôt need feedback, when I know I don‚Äôt have an media device playing.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AHPU6W5V6C27OP5ZZ2YZRRXQL7RA,1,31,Color: Black,"November 15, 2023",2023-11-15,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R3LFF2ULC02US9,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Has many flaws,RS,3.0,"I have used several headphones over the years - Sennheiser, Jabra, JayBird, Beats, Sony, SkullCandy, Bose, etc. Jabra is probably the best overall, in terms of battery life, fit, sound, wireless charging, headphone controls, and a small form factor. I have a Jabra Elite 75t and came across this ""never before immersive"" sound by Bose. I don't mind spending money for a great sound.Compared to other in-ear headphones in this market, for $300, Bose QC Ultra is bigger in size, and the charging case is heavier. Although, it does fit comfortably with the fins.The noise canceling is great. It almost completely blocks out all the noise around. But it also sometimes hurt my ears. I like the noise cancelling that I get in Jabra, and the excellent controls it offers that easily switches between ""active noise cancellation"" and ""hear through"" modes. Jabra has this ""hear through"" mode where it enhances the surrounding sounds, which is especially great inside airplanes if we need to temporarily listen to announcements while wearing the headphone. Bose doesn't offer any of these features. And the ""aware"" mode is sub-par. Absolutely not worth the $300 price tag.Also, I sometimes sleep with my headphones on. Jabra stays all night, never feels uncomfortable, and switches off when inactive for a while. Bose doesn't seem to have auto shut-off (probably it goes into an inactive mode without shutting off), it emits this continuous annoying low pitch sound. And due to its sensitive touch controls, there's no way to watch anything while lying on the side without accidentally pausing or toggling controls.¬†Which brings to the next point, the controls. Like others mentioned, I had accidentally paused or toggled the noise cancelling modes one too many times while adjusting the volume. Just for the poor controls alone, knocking one star off. I feel, the in-ear headphones should only have physical 'push' buttons and not touch controls. ""Long touch"", ""quick touch"", ""double touch"", ""drag for volume"", etc. aren't easy to get it right every time.Coming to the sound, I would not call it the best. On some occasions, the Jabra Elite 75t sounded far better. Bose's sound seems to have a little more detail, but only sometimes. Bass is alright, not too great. Sometimes, Bose's ""immersive sound"" hurts my ears.The Bluetooth disconnects/reconnects randomly. Also, it doesn't support connecting to multiple devices at the same time. Jabra supports multi-point active connection. If I am watching a movie on my laptop, and get a phone call on my mobile, the laptop automatically pauses and the phone rings on my earphone. Bose... $300... Why not?This is an alright in-ear headphone, among the dozen others in the market. But I could not find one reason to justify the $300 price tag, especially with a lot of shortcomings that even a $100 headphone offers.","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",AHSV5F4DEAX3VJFSJDAU5VFVHA4Q,1,59,Color: Black,"October 15, 2023",2023-10-15,2023-10,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

A quick tl;dr would be if you want the best noise cancellation paired with excellent audio go with the Bose and if you want exceptionally excellent audio with okayish noice cancellation go with the Sony. As far as comparison:The way the Bose unti fits into the ear is both more confortable and the seal is more complete creating a significant increase in the noise cancellation ability. The Sony part does not completely fill the ear and it sometimes feels like thay are going to fall out due to their weight distribution paired with the ear canal fit.As far as audio the Sony really seems to have richer and more bold sound. The Bose audoo is also great, it just seemed a bit flatter compared to the Sony audio.Insofar as app connectivity- I avoid apps like the plague but I found connectivity w/o the app to be superior with the Bose. It lent itself to connection easier without having to rely exclusivly on app assistance. The Sony also has a known issue where it will fail to turn off even when placed in its case. I had this happen with the Bose as well but only once in awhile- with the Sony it was consistent and drained the battery constantly leading to a return.For me, personally, the Bose hit all the boxes and did it smoothly with finesse but, again, it basically comes down to Excellent Audio but connectivity issues and okay ANC go with Sony; Excellent ANC and comfort fit with good connectivity but not as good audio go with the Bose.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AEAUJFSDYN7LYQYRXKXWWFFWBAIQ,1,24,Color: Moonstone Blue,"May 28, 2024",2024-05-28,2024-05,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

RPPZ84Y5531SN,B0CD2FSRDD,"2.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly bad, returned",haggis,2.0,"I own and like the original Bose Quietcomfort buds so I expected to be blown away by these. Unfortunately I was disappointed and returned these. They are smaller than the original QC buds, but not as comfortable since the interface between bud and ear does not have as much springy rubber like the original QC buds do. These are mostly hard where they touch your ear. I do like that they have adopted a ""twist to tighten"" approach which works very well on Jabra buds for instance, but the way Bose have implemented it is not perfect and overall the buds manage to be both slightly uncomfortable and at the same time, not perfectly secure feeling, like they might not stay in during a run. They aren't terrible, but they aren't perfect.They are surprisingly hard to take out of the case, the magnet that holds them in the case is too strong and they are hard to get a grip on.The packaging is pretty low-budget, which isnt a big deal to me, but is a little bit weird for such an expensive pair of headphones. The out-of-box experience is a little unpolished, for instance when setting up the buds in the app they launch into a demo of the immersive audio, but the demo was pretty loud so I pushed the volume down button on my phone, and this caused the demo to crash. Then when trying to use the Bose app to turn Immersive audio on and off, there is a huge delay and the buttons are not very responsive. This was on the latest version of both the app, and the bud firmware. Little things like that add up and make the overall experience seem kind of janky, especially for such an expensive item where my expectation is that things should pretty much be flawless at this price.The real dealbreaker for me is that the ANC is just miserable and fatiguing. I expect there to be some ""rushing wind/white noise"" in ANC buds, but these have such a loud white noise when nothing is playing that it actually is fatiguing to have the buds in with no music playing. This is a big disappointment as sometimes on a bus or plane I want to just use ANC to cancel noise, but have nothing playing so I can just have silence. There is no real silence with these buds, there is only a loud whooshing noise. The whooshing is constant even in environments that are already very quiet, where the ANC should barely be doing anything at all. My original QC buds have some whooshing from ANC but it is very quiet compared to these. Even worse, there is a noticeable electronic chirp periodically in the left bud when nothing is playing. It sounds almost like a dialup modem sound or a mosquito. There is also no real way that I could find to fully turn off the ANC, your only choices in the app are ANC, Immersive, or the mode that pipes outside noise in so you can hear what is going on around you, but I could not find a way to truly turn the ANC off.The immersive audio feature does sound pretty cool but for me it seemed like more of a novelty gimmick. I enjoyed it for about 10 minutes and then it started to feel pretty fatiguing. It almost sounds like in a car stereo when you turn the ""loudness"" setting way up, certain parts of the music get really boomy and the music just sounds super aggressively EQed. It does sound pretty cool for a few minutes but I couldn't see myself using it as a daily thing.At this super premium price, there are too many issues.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AGXSQNHR7EVQJCONAXHVLHS74LCA,1,81,Color: Black,"November 30, 2023",2023-11-30,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

They were very simple to start up, sync, and use out of the box. The instructions and app are clear and intuitive.I have used wireless earbuds in the past that don't fit well in my ears, so I was initially apprehensive, but these fit like a glove. No adjustments needed, and no signs of moving or falling out. Truly a perfect fit, and not painful or clumsy feeling at all.The sound quality is great, exactly what you would expect from a Bose premium audio offering. I have used these for audiobooks, podcasts, and music. I haven't used them for phone calls yet. The noise cancelation feature works pretty decent, depending on which mode you use. For example, the other day there were 3 helicopters circling above early in the morning and the sound was virtually drowned out in Quiet Mode.The case is sleek and well fitting, easy to use, and holds a good charge. I've used them over multiple days and have not needed to charge yet.I like that the mode offerings allow you different experiences. Quiet is the ultimate in noise cancelation. Aware is great if you are biking or running and want to be aware of sounds around you for safety but still have amazing sound quality on what you're listening to. Immersion is where you feel like the sound is surrounding you and adjusting to your position.My only complaint so far is that the earbud sensors are a little sensitive so if you accidentally hit them the sound goes out and then I end up tapping obsessively to get them back on. I've found in this case it's easier to restart from my device (phone in this case) than worry about the taps.Also, the little safety book included had print so tiny you practically need a magnifying glass. At that point, just save trees and include the info on the QR code provided.","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2023",AFO4QZOC2NZAD2PGHV6QQZZ3ZE3A,1,21,Color: Black,"November 16, 2023",2023-11-16,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
RW32MMM3Y0T65,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Very good sound. Very annoying connectivity,Jon,3.0,"I was about to buy the sennheiser ear buds but read too many reviews about poor connectivity despite the excellent sound quality. So, I spent even more and got these Bose ear buds. I figured Bose has been in the wireless headphone game long enough to not have connectivity issues, but these are super annoying. Sound quality is excellent. Blows my apple AirPods away. Not even close. Great deep base and excellent noise cancelling. But, these things lose connection all the time. Even just switching apps, they‚Äôll disconnect and you have to figure out the issue. Sometimes I have to turn my phone off and back on and sometimes I have to put them back in the case and try again. It‚Äôs unpredictable and they really really need a software update or something. The pods themselves feel well made and I have no complaints except the case feels mega cheap and flimsy. The apple case feels very sturdy even after 3 years. This one feels like the lid might break at any moment.Over all. I‚Äôm pretty happy with these, but Bose could do better. They only nailed the sound quality and noise cancellation and those were the main things I was looking for.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AHKU3PKOSOKX5DMT45XLRCCWKEQA,1,0,Color: White Smoke,"June 13, 2024",2024-06-13,2024-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R22FNL5GFDSU3K,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars All in all a great product.,Amazon Customer,4.0,"I upgraded from the 1st generation quiet comfort earbuds. Connection to multiple devices is much better but still not as good as Apple EarPods. The fit in the ears took a lot of getting used to especially in the right ear and I think the older model was more comfortable in spite of the fact that the older ones are bigger and heavier. The touch controls are not very responsive. To change modes one is supposed to touch the left ear bud but most times I do that it just stops the music. Also so far I‚Äôve not managed to control the volume by touch. The sound is very much the same as the older model, the noise cancellation is superb and immersive mode is really good. All in all a worthwhile upgrade. The only thing I don‚Äôt understand is that the earbuds are sold with three sizes of ear tips and stability bands and they sell other sizes separately for $10 or $15. I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt add the $10 to the price and ship the ear buds with the extra sizes (or not add the $10). It seems to me they are selling an incomplete product this way.","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AHRA5IA5OZTDIJXY2MTP2APWJMUQ,1,0,Color: Black,"March 23, 2024",2024-03-23,2024-03,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

They are pricey but you get what you pay for. That said, after a little over a year, they just stopped working. Thankfully I'd purchased an Amazon extended warranty and they refunded me the full price. Being optimistic, I immediately ordered another pair. These only lasted a little over 2 months until problems started. First, suddenly no one could hear me when answering calls. I had to switch call audio to my phone. Then, the earbud audio started cycling through the various audio modes on a continuous loop and the only way to stop it was to redock the ear buds in the charger. Finally I lost all audio on the left ear bud. Initially this was intermittent but within 2 weeks, it was full time. At the time, I was listening mainly to audio books but still it was very annoying. I contacted Bose and they are sending me another pair (within a few weeks). When they work, they are very amazing. I've had Bose headsets and various earbuds for quite a few years and never had any issues. Their sound quality for under $300 is incredible so I'll probably stick with Bose. I just wish they would add some additional features that are becoming standard.

They have some issues but Bose also does a lot right. Starting with the fit these are the best fitting earbuds I've used. They aren't the most comfortable (though they are pretty comfortable even for long periods) but when they go in my ear they stay there. Every other set of buds I've used I have to keep pushing them back in throughout the day, especially if I yawn or move around alot, with the Bose I never had to do that, not even once. The bose also do a great job of not giving you that pressure feel when these buds are in your ear. The active noise cancellation is also the best I've ever used, I work around heavy equipment that is loud at times and these buds have no issues blocking most of that out allowing me to listen to my music at low volumes. This is a huge deal to me because I hate playing music loud as it hurts my ears. Sound quality is subjective but I really like the sound profile of Bose. They aren't the most accurate sounding buds but they sound great and I can listen to them all day without listening fatigue. The only complaints I have is I wish the battery life was better, especially since the case and buds are larger than usual. And the call quality is barely passable but no where near as good as some of the competitors.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023",AGRBZB52YP242ZUKO26UY36EGLSQ,1,5,Color: Black,"December 3, 2023",2023-12-03,2023-12,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

I primarily use them for the gym and running so I need ones that stay in place. The ""fruit"" ones never stayed in place. I was always adjusting them or having them fall out when bending over. I took a chance with these Bose ones and have found my forever pair.Sound:The sound is amazing and the noise canceling makes me smile everytime. Just used them on a plane and it was like I wasn't in a plane. Bass is impressive from such a small device. I usually run it at 60% volume and that is enough.Fit:However the key feature for me is how Bose utilized 2 different rubber pieces for fitment. The earbud portion and this ring that tucks up into the curve of your ear. The ring is what has prevented these from falling out or moving during exercise. I will never buy a pair of earbuds again that does not have this feature. Bose even includes 3 different sized rings and earbuds so you are destined to find the perfect fit. My girlfriend used mine one day and also bought a pair. She had similar reactions to it.Battery:Battery life is great which is expected from a new device. I can usually get like 11 - 12 hours out of the case. I usually only have to charge it everyother week and that gets me through 12 trips to the gym at an hour a piece.Conclusion:They are pricey but definitely worth it.

RY3008CZA7SZL,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Headphones,Chris B.,5.0,"I bought these headphones after using the cheapest possible headphones for my entire life. I now consider all of that wasted time. Until I put these in, I largely thought ""noise cancellation"" was a myth unless you counted heavy over-ear just blocking outside noise through sheer size. Not so. These are a straight-up marvel. I was sitting in a large classroom yesterday with 90+ students all talking before class started. With noise cancellation on but nothing playing, the roar was a distant muffle. With music on, I could hear absolutely nothing going on around me. Aside from the noise cancellation, these are still incredible headphones. When I'm on my motorcycle, I put them on under my helmet in active mode and they allow me to hear what's going on around me, but I can also hear my music over my straight-piped Harley, even when I'm going ""the speed limit."" The sound quality is, as you might guess by the brand, wonderful. You don't really know what you're missing listening to music on poor-quality headphones. If you love music, I really can't recommend these highly enough. I'm hearing things I never noticed before on some of my favorite songs because I've never heard them on quality headphones before. The app is whatever, you can use it to customize the long press function and find your buds if you lose them, but other than that, I don't see myself using it basically ever. The earbuds feel super secure. I put a tight full face helmet on over them and they don't move. I run on the treadmill, I train on a heavy bag, I use the rowing machine, they don't move. At no point have I ever felt like they might fall out. The only minor gripe I have is that if I'm paying upwards of $300, I'd like a little better battery life. I get just under 6 hours on a charge and if I'm on a long plane trip or whatever, I'd like to be able to use them all day without stopping to charge, but it's a minor gripe because how often are you really going to be using headphones for 6+ hours without ever taking a break?TL;DR These are amazing headphones, definitely worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AGLO45QJWZQDTEXEQSGPRZQUM3YA,1,6,Color: Black,"January 23, 2024",2024-01-23,2024-01,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

R1IGP18B0L8ROZ,B0CD2FSRDD,2.0 out of 5 stars 2 stars due to glitching,Stephanie Moreno,2.0,"Update: I returned them. The main reason I returned is the glitching and connectivity issues. I found myself getting angry and wanting to yeet them out the window. I LOVE the sound quality! But I couldn‚Äôt get past these issues.Original review:I previously owned the QC earbuds, the original ones. Loved them. So I naturally assume these are better‚Ä¶.they are not, at all.Issue #1 Sound glitching. My main issue is the sound keeps glitching. I thought I could just ignore it. I‚Äôm easy to please. Nope. When im scrolling on my phone it happens more. Incredibly irritating.Issue #2 Sound quality. I hope I have a faulty pair of earbuds. The sound is subpar/weird sounding compared to the original QCs. The old ones felt more immersive. These almost sound like I‚Äôm under water. I do however, like the noise canceling. Idk how I broke the NC on my old pair but I could always hear everything regardless of having it in NC mode or not. I‚Äôm so happy I can‚Äôt hear people talking when I‚Äôm listening to music (introvert problems).Issue #3 Connectivity. While it connects fine. It‚Äôs just not as quick when switching devices. When going from my laptop to phone, I clicked on the earbuds in the bluetooth menu. It tries to connect a full cycle but fails. I click them again and they connect. Not too much of an issue for me but still annoying.Issue #4 Case, fit, and controls. I very much dislike the new case. Solely because I liked being able to look at the case and know how much battery is left. To be fair, that info is in the boss app. It‚Äôll just take a few times of checking the app and I‚Äôd probably no longer care about the case telling me. But still something to note if you‚Äôre coming from the OGs. I do prefer the new case as it‚Äôs less bulky, however taking out the earbuds is odd. I have to pinch the rubber on the earbuds and pull up. I have no suggestion for a remedy. It‚Äôs just awkward. I‚Äôm sure with practice I‚Äôll find a workaround. Now for the controls, I enjoy the controls much better. Both earbuds do the same thing. That‚Äôs great! The old ones, the left one changed the song and the right one paused/played. So if I only had the right one in, it got annoying. The left one, for whatever reason, didn‚Äôt work on its own. I also never looked into the issue, I just accepted it. So it very well could‚Äôve been user error. As for fit, I prefer the fit of these. The rubber/silicone earbuds are softer. The old ones were more firm. I ALWAYS wear my earbuds. Music is the background of my life. That being said, the old ones made my ear swell at night while sleeping. I simply stopped sleeping with them in, problem solved. So on the nights I really needed music, I just dealt with a swollen ear. The material on these however, do not cause that.All-in-all, I desperately want to like these headphones. I‚Äôm going to give them a week of use and check back. If the audio keeps glitching, I will return/replace and update this review. Hopefully it‚Äôs not a product issue and I just received a defect.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AG5XVPNJZ6E65XLPF5CBD52IVSEQ,1,7,Color: Black,"February 10, 2024",2024-02-10,2024-02,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
RZNI3Q4GGG5TV,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Only thing saving Bose now is the wing stabilizers. Wind is problem. Lower engineering quality,Brian Myers,3.0,"I'm pretty loyal to Bose, but the newest earbuds, while they have better quality emitted audio are of lower quality than previous products. Wind is more of a factor than it was 2 generations ago. They regularly lose the sound envelope and need to reestablish. The touch controls are much less user friendly and adjustable than 2 generations ago. The initial connectivity is less than 80%. Frequently, one has to place the earbuds back in the case, allow them to reset, and then put them back into ones ears as upon initial use one of the buds fails to activate or the sound is diminished.Since no other quality earbuds possess wings, I still prefer to use Bose, but after 2 weeks of use, I'd rather use the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds than Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If someone else adds stabilizers beyond the silicon tips (or foam) in my ear canal, I'll probably switch.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AHOFHJNLFZ2LRBA57YOJ67TS4M6A,1,0,Color: Moonstone Blue,"May 29, 2024",2024-05-29,2024-05,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

Great on the other criteria on both buds but only one major downfall and same problem for both of them! The buds can not paired with more than 1 device, otherwise it will be laggy. Searched on Bose website, it solves the problem as long as I reset the earbuds and forgot the device on my phone or my computer. However....I have to do this every single time when I switch the device, either my computer or my phone.... It's time consuming and frustrating. My previous Sony XM3 never had those problems. I did not notice the problem until my 30 days return is over. Well...the sound quality is still so great that I will recommend those buds if you are not using it on multiple devices.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AGAN75NGBIJNLDDEV325H57SOV5Q,1,0,Color: White Smoke,"June 27, 2024",2024-06-27,2024-06,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

I sit next to an extremely annoying coworker who loudly clears his throat all day long but with these I can't hear a thing. The immersion mode is great for anyone with misophonia. The only thing dropping these to a 3 stars is what appears to be a common connection issue -- every once in a while the right earbud will just refuse to turn on. I have to spend 5-10 minutes putting it in the case and taking it back out until it works again, which is very frustrating on brand new $250 earbuds. Had one instance where the right earbud didn't charge overnight so I'm guessing the issue is coming from the case. Currently exchanging for a new set to see if that solves the problem, but without that issue these would be a 5 all day. The Bose app is also useless as even while actively listening to the earbuds they just won't connect to the app most of the time. Sound quality is good -- nothing like my powered Sennheiser headphones but definitely don't expect that from earbuds. Comfort is great, barely feels like I have earbuds in.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2024",AEJ636WWXOINGDZTKSDXF5BC3OLQ,1,1,Color: Black,"April 3, 2024",2024-04-03,2024-04,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

I wish that I had purchased the Beats audio earbuds to go with my Apple phone. However, the Bose earbuds are high-quality and work well with other devices that are not Apple products. Apple products for some reason do not allow you to use the full volume and sound that the Bose earbud can actually provide for you.

Far better than any other buds I've heard, including the Airpods. The ear seal is quite good, so bass is very consistent. Audio quality is quite good, and it's nice to have an app to customize noise cancelling and frequency response, though the controls are fairly basic (bass, mid, treble cut and boost).The Bad: Wind noise is a real problem; if you're biking with them on, or just walking in a windy environment, the wind noise is pretty annoying and significantly worse than with Airpods. The connection to the iPhone is not as smooth/easy as the Airpods - it suffers from occasional glitchiness with the L/R pairing briefly getting out of sync - only for a fraction of a second at a time. Also, I've had occasional issues where they won't connect for a phone call, then they do. So definitely not as well-integrated into the Apple OS as Airpods.Overall good quality, but I wish they were better in a breeze, and I wish the bluetooth connection were more solid.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023",AHIMDWDQMPHFTH4SNSLGP67J6XNA,1,1,Color: Black,"December 3, 2023",2023-12-03,2023-12,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R1YDGRJOD0U8JM,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow,Ray,5.0,"I‚Äôll keep this review short because so many people have had the exact same experience as my own using these headphones, and all I‚Äôll be doing is repeating long reams of written text saying just that. What I WILL say, however, is to sum this up, these are remarkably good sounding headphones that boggle the mind with their execution into little, tiny earpods. Sound quality is unbelievably good. The active noise cancellation is without doubt best-in-class. And the comfort level is better than any other earpod to the extent that you‚Äôll find yourself trying to figure out just why they are so darn comfortable. The immersive sound works well in most cases, although it is not at all necessary to have a maximally enjoyable audio experience. Whether or not they are worth $300 is one of those imponderables, but let me say you forget about the price as soon as you start listening to them. In a time when so many products fail to live up to expectations even while costing a lot, these Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones are a breath of fresh air. These earn my top recommendation.A LITTLE MORE ON COMFORTAfter using these headphones for a number of weeks now I must come back and add a few sentences on wearing comfort. I can't explain how it is achieved, but these are without a doubt the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn. Some say it is because of the silicone wrap that encircles part of the earbud, and that reason sounds as good as any to me, but regardless, these things are COMFORTABLE. I've fallen asleep with them in my ears a number of times at bedtime and wake up with no ear discomfort at all even after hours of wearing. The ""Ultra's"" seem a tad more comfortable than the previous-generation ""II"" earbuds (although those are very comfortable, too), and, in my opinion, noticeably more comfortable than the Technics az-80's that are currently the subject of much discussion. If you can get a pair during the holiday sales, all the better. These are astonishingly comfortable earbuds that sound wonderful and its just too bad we lose wireless charging and multi-point connection. But it's worth it!","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AF7G4AGU43VKWFVSHFQS4L72EQ6Q,1,1,Color: White Smoke,"November 11, 2023",2023-11-11,2023-11,Bose,Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds
R1SXNWG67VYW2G,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Goodbye ear fatigue (but I‚Äôm still returning),Sevgi Gokce Kafali,4.0,"When I made the decision on spending 300$ on ultra open earbuds (I call them Hearrings) my reasoning was that I listen to very long podcasts and youtube videos, and my ears get fatigued after these sessions. Therefore I could justify the high price tag. And I must say that the r&d that went into this product really delivers on that end. I never thought I‚Äôd be returning these because I thought the elimination of the ear fatigue was the only important thing about any earbuds for me and other features or shortcomings are unimportant. I was wrong. Below I‚Äôll try to list my reasons for returning and I hope it helps prospect buyers (I have iPhone 15 pro):1) I do most of my listening on YouTube and for some reason the single press for play and pause functionality is very unstable. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn‚Äôt and I couldn‚Äôt figure out a pattern. More complex button press combinations like volume adjustments etc. always work but play/pause just don‚Äôt work some times. And its really annoying when my phone is in another room and I can‚Äôt pause something.2) there‚Äôs always this hissing sound in the background when I‚Äôm playing videos. It‚Äôs usually not very noticeable but I notice it in quieter periods and it is annoying. It stops 1 or 2 seconds after I stopped the video, so I know it‚Äôs not coming from the video I‚Äôm watching.3) when I resume a video, even though the playback starts immediately on my phone, the sound starts coming to my ears after a second and I miss a word or two. Very annoying.4) I realized I switched very often between my phone, ipad and MacBook. And I realized how convenient my earpods were when they automatically connect to the device I‚Äôm using. Which is not the case for these earbuds and I have to manually change every time I switch. Annoying.I hope some of these issues are just defects on my unit and/or are fixed soon with software updates. I might‚Äôve kept these as my second pair of earbuds where I only use for long term listening if I have paid something around 100-150$ range. But after paying 300$ I feel a bit ripped off and therefore I decided to return.I will buy these again in a year to see if the issues are fixed and I can finally have my dream earbuds. But until then I‚Äôll try other things like bone conduction etc.I‚Äôm still giving 4 stars despite the shortcomings because of all the r&d that must‚Äôve went into coming up with this amazing design and functionality.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AFO4LTAJUKWRQLFRGQZCKAPOLLHA,1,10,Color: Black,"May 29, 2024",2024-05-29,2024-05,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R37PX6TMZHPGKF,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Expensive Niche product that is exactly what I want,Alvin A. Santos,4.0,I've been looking for earbuds that give me awareness while engaging in sports. Most of the open earbuds or bone conduction headphones have some kind of ear hook. I wear glasses or goggles and helmets and having something around the top of the ear is uncomfortable. They fit underneath my ski helmet ear pads - I do have ear pads that accept speakers so there is a small void. The key to the whole thing is that they sit and connect around the middle or lower part of your ear so as not to interfere with anything above your ear.The second thing I was looking for was a pair of earbuds that doesn't go into the ear canal. I have some irritation inside my ear and wearing most earbuds causes my ear to itch after awhile. These sit outside the ear so the canal is still open so you can hear around you.I docked one star for a few reasons.1 - cost - at $300 these are very expensive.1a - you need to pay another $50 to get wireless charging - and the case becomes larger with the sleeve2 - battery life - immersive audio is very nice but really kills the battery life.3 - no multipoint connection. You have to use a shortcut to switch devicesTaken together I think that it worth a 1 star loss - but overall I am pleased with them and I can wear them all day (unfortunately the battery doesn't last that long)Summary of what I was looking for in open earbuds:1 - Spatial awareness2 - non-irritating to the ear3 - non-interference with eyeglasses or goggles or helmet,"Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024",AEXERLHM5LKUBKUPKFGI6AK6J6JQ,1,1,Color: White,"June 26, 2024",2024-06-26,2024-06,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R1LBISM8SYYKVW,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars I personally like it but...,JYK,4.0,"I personally like it (mainly by its look and how comfortable it feels at my ears) but this is indeed baffling and somewhat self-defeating product.By its designed nature, its major point is to NOT block other sounds surrouding you rather than noise cancelling. The idea seemed appealing to me cause I almost never use my noice-cancelling earbuds when walking outside and only use them when I'm riding bus or subway. I just don't feel safe and comfortable about noise-cancelling when walking on the roads. However, not-noise-cancelling means whatever sound coming out of earbuds naturally degrades for its sound quality. It's intended trade-off. So at the point, sounds quality kinda doesn't really matter. And if sounds quality kinda doesn't matter, is this price level worth it? Maybe not unless you are really attracted to the product for whatever random reason, like me.As a someone who doesn't really have sophisticated ears, sound quality seemed pretty well WHEN using these inside of the building. They somehow weirdly even provide somewhat unintended noice-cancelling effect IF inside the building.Although it may not look like it, it remains attached at my ears very comfortably and stable. I even tried running with it and had no problems. However, I can even say it's too comfortable. I used this earbuds during my long-lasting walking trip (6-8hrs of walking everyday for 3 weeks) and there were few occassions where I accidently dropped one piece of the earbuds while rearranging my hat however way. The hat hit a pair of the earbuds but I don't get to really recognize it dropped because the earbuds are so light, so losing it doesn't make me feel sufficiently different. Moreover, if it happens where cars are actively riding on their roads, just one remainder earbud playing music makes me have no doubt and concern even though the other one is kissing with dirt on random part of pedestrian road.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AFCY5YA7JF2K2B5M5UYPSLJ4FFZQ,1,6,Color: White,"June 3, 2024",2024-06-03,2024-06,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

R1FQZQF75CQA09,B0CPFV77W4,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Not Comfortable",BV,4.0,"I placed my order on Amazon and received my Bose Open Earbuds the next day. Set-up was very easy. I already had the Bose app, however if you do not, you would need to download the app. On the app there is a tutorial of what to do as well as settings to make changes to your liking. You can change modes, adjust equalizer settings, shortcuts, and your Bluetooth source. It displays the battery life of each earbud and what you‚Äôre listening to. Another feature is that you can pick your shortcut and which earbud to use said shortcut. One issue with the app is that it does not always connect immediately even though the case is nearby, and I am using the earbuds. I usually must leave the app, press the button on the case and go back in the app for the connection to work. I usually use only one earbud at a time. However, when using both earbuds, you can still hear your surroundings, which is why I only wear one. However, there are times when I only want to hear what‚Äôs coming from the buds and not my surroundings and because of the open buds I cannot. I like that there in nothing going inside my ear canal. However, the big barrel behind my ear and the way it must clip onto the ear, starts to hurt within the hour. So, comfortability is very short lived, which is unfortunate since I wear my buds for hours. Aesthetically, they are a little bulky looking, but they look nice. The earbuds sound great. Listening to audible books and when talking on the phone, the sound is clear and quality great. Others can hear what you are listening to if they are nearby, which I do not like. Background noises are very amplified in comparison to my voice when I am talking on the phone. When I am in a quiet environment, my callers can hear me clearly. The earbuds tell you when you connect them, when the battery life is running low, and the phone number calling you. There is a little bit of a lag when using the play/pause feature. Sometimes the play/pause feature does not work at all, and I must use the app of the program I am listening to to get started. The longevity of the battery life for the case and ear buds are great.

R3P87R62TYYO8X,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars The future of audio is here!,HH,4.0,"When Bose first announced these earbuds, I was very skeptical on how these open style earbuds would perform in terms of audio clarity in which Bose is known for. My previous earbuds, I always set them to noise cancellation especially when in a loud noisy environment such as the gym and hear through when I'm at work. These earbuds has eliminated both of these features so you're able to hear outside noise at all times. This takes some getting use to but after a few hours I had gotten use to it.Another thing that took some getting use to was putting these earbuds on but it didn't take very long to get accustomed to. These look like a pair of earrings that are put on awkwardly but I find that they do stay on very well compared to my in-ear buds. I was able to lay on one side while in bed and always shook my head and they managed to stay on where was the in ear fly out with the slightest shake. After awhile, I don't even feel anything in my ear at all and that I can wear these all day and won't ache my ear like those in-ear earbuds. With the fitment of these buds out the way, let's talk about the audio aspect.These sound pretty well but you're giving up noise cancellation. Can hear my laundry machine yet able to hear the audio pretty well. Not sure how well these would work if you're on airplane. You're not getting high bass but Bose isn't known for their bass. The treble/voice sounds great. Almost sounds acoustic in a way which I like vs bass. You're giving up noise cancellation and hear through features but a nifty feature these Ultra Open Earbuds offer is the Immersive Audio feature. This basically puts the audio in front of you so no matter where you turn your head, the audio will always be played in front of you. So if your turn your head left or right, the side that is in front will be played and the the side furthest way will be silent. Basically you have the option for audio to stay in one place or audio to follow you around this enchancing your audio experience.The charging case is very compact in which I prefer. Fits in your pocket nicely.Comfort factor I give 10/10. Overall I give the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds a 8/10.

R3FNIIH39C56EI,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Unique but Enjoyable,rguise,4.0,"These were a drastic change from any other earbuds that I have used or, even seen, before. I had not heard of ""open earbuds"" before seeing these come out, and now will use them as my daily pair. The design of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds is unique insofar as they sort of softly clamp onto the ear itself, and have a well-designed, pointed speaker that projects the audio into your, otherwise open, ear canal.These really DO work well with balancing out a noisy environment while listening to something more personally enjoyable, like a podcast. I have a young son and for years have worn just one ear bud, so that I could hear him and interact with him, but also listen to things that might be entertaining to me, at the same time. These bring that ""use case"" to life and almost perfectly allow the two audio worlds, to blend together nicely.However, I can very easily see myself losing one in the future if I am not constantly checking that it is still in and/or trying to avoid anything that would touch my head and could knock it loose. I have already had them fall off once, and very easily could have lost it forever. I really wish Bose would provide some sort of auditory ""ping"" that you could use if one were to, say, almost get eaten by the couch cushion.They also perform extremely well, with regards to easily connecting via Bluetooth or pairing to your devices, as you'd expect. Some other earbuds can make that process nightmarish the longer you have to do things in a very specific order to connect them. These have been near flawless with regard to ease of connectivity between my phone, tablet, and other Bluetooth devices.The sound quality is ""top-tier"", which is what you would expect from a reputable company such as Bose. The design of them is wonderful if you have needs that these would help out with. However, I don't know if I would truly pay top dollar for a pair if I did not. There are other pairs with stronger bass and richer sound, due to having more of the driver closer to your ear. But, if you want something that allows you to be more ""there"" with those around you, while still enjoying a podcast or listening to a show, these are a phenomenal choice.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2024",AGQIJ33LQ5WNGPI6AZ3ZEZZX64XQ,1,7,Color: Black,"April 1, 2024",2024-04-01,2024-04,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I‚Äôm not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn‚Äôt even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don‚Äôt get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven‚Äôt had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They‚Äôre IPX4 rated, so I‚Äôm not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I‚Äôm surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn‚Äôt shake them out. They‚Äôre not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update.

R1OCNYX8PZALWD,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Love them but had an allergic reaction and had to return,Female,4.0,"I felt these were super comfortable on my ears. I have a very hard time with earbuds staying in. But I‚Äôve also had an allergic reaction to the Samsung buds in the past. I hear it‚Äôs the waterproof coating. I was excited when I heard about the Bose headphones since I love their sound stage, but every time I wore it I got a rash right on the back of my left ear (only) where it sits. I triedI have bone conduction shocks that I really like, but the band behind the ear or not the greatest and I felt the sound is a little hollow, but that‚Äôs granted it‚Äôs bone conduction. I was hoping this would be a nice in between since my AirPods can‚Äôt stay in. For me these were perfection. I was able to get good sound quality but not drown out other noises so it‚Äôs safe for when I ride my bike or walk my dog. I could wear them for long period of time and they were comfortable. They feel cool and futuristic, and I love the settings of still and immersive. But if you had a reaction to other earbuds in the past like I have, these may have the same problem for you as it did with me. This is my saddest return.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AH2E32GK6YZA7IRX4PHPXX32UC6A,1,1,Color: White,"May 29, 2024",2024-05-29,2024-05,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
RDONWSPZXH0K7,B0CPFV77W4,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good concept, however, needs work‚Ä¶.",FC,3.0,"Loved that these rested in the ear cuff. The concept is great! Very comfortable! The problem is that everyone can hear whatever it is you‚Äôre listening to, which means they can hear your phone calls as well.The video that Bose uses to give you an idea of sound leakage is not accurate. If you are about 50%, in volume, others can hear. 30% will give leakage, just not as bad but it would be enough to irritate those around you. If you tend to listen to music or whatever at the 30 to 50% level, this is not for you. Depending on the movie you may be watching, you may have to turn up the volume for that movie, which will give sound leakage.These cannot be used in a library but a louder setting, like if you were in a dining hall or where there is outside noise that the sound leakage would be fine, walking to the train!I will say this, if you are not concerned with sound leakage or other‚Äôs listening to your calls, these are for you. The sound is incredible! But, I will say that the over the ear canal may be better. I am checking out the Lenovo erazer.I do see others that are similar to these, where they rest over the ear canal. I think if they offered a partial in ear, that would be a huge seller.

R2A8EL0OKIY35M,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars First time Open Ear bud user.,Nick Papyan,4.0,"Let me preface this by saying these Bose Open Earbuds are a bit niche. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I've been loving them so far.Sound that surprised me:Honestly, I figured the open design would mean weak sound. But wow, was I wrong! The sound is actually really unique and immersive, kind of like having a speaker next to you with surround sound on. It's clear and full, even without completely blocking out everything around you.Comfort is king:These are seriously the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn. They're so light you barely notice them, which is perfect for long listening sessions.Motorcycle test (because why not?):I figured I'd see how they handled some wind noise. To my surprise, they held up pretty well on my motorcycle up to about 60mph on a windy day. The sound stayed clear, and I even had to turn it down sometimes because it was a little too loud and blocked out traffic noise.Not for everyone:Now, these aren't noise-cancelling headphones. Don't even try to compare them. They're more like a compliment to your existing noise-cancelling headphones. Perfect for when you want something light and airy that lets you hear what's going on around you.Other cool stuff: Pairing is a breeze. You can use the Bose app (similar to AirPods connecting to iPhones) or just regular Bluetooth. I had no problems connecting them to multiple devices. Super easy to use. Just pop them in your ears, and they turn on and connect to your latest device. Switching connections is simple too, with a button right on the earbuds. Battery life seems accurate based on what they advertise. Just remember, the fancy immersive mode drains the battery faster. Charging the buds in the case is super quick, though.My only gripe? The price:At $300, they're a bit on the expensive side. The case feels kinda cheap too, like flimsy plastic. Not exactly AirPods case quality.Overall:If you're sick of bulky headphones and ear fatigue (looking at you, gym sessions), and want something that lets you hear what's around you, the Bose Open Earbuds are a great choice. Just keep in mind the price and the case quality before you pull the trigger.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2024",AHVSC3FORPZUGRBGLFEDH3OQYSSA,1,14,Color: Black,"April 3, 2024",2024-04-03,2024-04,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

R2XZRT2Z5QSSEF,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic new earbud technology held back by years-old issues,Fahad,4.0,"What I wanted out of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds was a product I: (1) would not have to take out when I talk to people, (2) could rely on to drown out subway and street noise, and (3) could listen to loudly at times without worrying about significant noise bleed irritating the people around me.The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds sound fantastic. It took a few hours, but I found a sweet spot for volume that allowed me to listen to music and treat it as ""background noise"" while I could also talk to people I see throughout the day (e.g., people at the gym check-in, familiar coffee shop faces). But there is just no way to even mildly drown out the street noise without having the volume on its highest, and even then, I could still hear it. And the subway? Phew, even worse.I had a friend walk around the city with me to see if he could hear my music clearly at different volume levels. Indoors, he could hear at 40% volume. Outdoors, at 60% volume. This is understandably a product that other people will hear, given the ""open"" part of it, but I was hoping that Bose somehow found a way to push the envelope forward a bit more.Regarding comfort, I love the first hour every time I put these on. But after an hour, there is pain/fatigue in the cartilage/earlobe area that these are clasped around, and when I eventually take them off, these areas feel very tender/sore.The biggest issue, though, is a connectivity problem not unique to ""open"" earbuds. For every song I listen to (~ three minutes each), the earbuds lose audio connection for approximately two seconds at least twice. I often find myself taking them off and putting them away and going back to other headphones I have because of how frustrating it is to experience audio loss that often (~35 instances/hour). The frequency of the audio drop will likely cause me to return these. $300 earbuds should not experience issues like this, especially when every other Bose product does not. I am not sure why this one is any different, yet here we are.Overall, this is a fantastic product held back by old issues. The other ""issues"" I faced represent the consequences of city living. I guess the connection issues will be resolved via software update, but I do not intend to wait around with them to find out.3.5/5","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2024",AHVMRLMMIVSXC4ROVAL7XPSXTOGA,1,2,Color: Black,"March 11, 2024",2024-03-11,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R3T0EE3QV2I3MU,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great but kinda loose on smaller ears.,Timmy,4.0,"The Bose sound system offers excellent audio quality, with the ability to control both bass and treble through a convenient app. The music playback is impressive, delivering a rich bass and clear treble that enhance the listening experience.However, I encountered an issue when receiving phone calls. The sound quality during calls was problematic, as it often felt like I was in a large, echoing room. This could potentially be related to the acoustics of my living environment or the height of my building, but it's something that users should be aware of and test for themselves.Additionally, my partner, who is of a smaller stature, found the earpiece to be too large and loose. This resulted in a suboptimal listening experience, as the earpiece needed to be manually adjusted to achieve the desired bass sound. This suggests that the earpiece design may not be suitable for individuals with smaller ears.Overall, while the Bose sound system excels in music playback with its adjustable bass and treble, there are notable issues with the phone call functionality and the fit of the earpiece for some users.

ROLF2OOY7WPZU,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars What I Needed All Along! Lightweight too!,Romeo985,5.0,"It is exactly as the title of my review implies...this is what I needed all along. I much prefer earbuds to over-the-ear headphones or any other headsets. I've owned other earbuds before but they were never as enabling as these. One of my main focuses was an audio device that provided great sound but still allowed me to be aware of my surroundings. I wanted to be able to hear and respond to someone if they were calling for me or be aware of any important sounds/alerts while I was commuting. These Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are just that. I've always been predisposed to think that Bose was a high-end brand specializing in audio equipment and delivering quality sound. After testing, I feel like my opinion was validated. Firstly, I must reinstate these Open Earbuds so the sound won't be as immersive and the base and treble won't be as strong as earbuds designed to isolate and block out external sounds. You have to acknowledge this and know what you're buying. You will and are meant to hear your surroundings when you put on these earbuds. Despite all this, I don't feel like I am missing out. If I were to put the volume high enough, it feels immersive to me when I want it to and it sounds like the outside environment is drowned out. But most times I will have it at a volume where I can hear everything happening. As mentioned, this is the main reason I opted for this product. I sometimes work on inventory and stock-keeping tasks in an open space where people can come and go. I am also working with the rest of my colleagues. I want to be able to listen to music/podcast while I work but at the same time, not be too immersed to block out all sounds, where I can't hear someone walk up behind me. Or even not hear my colleagues call out for me. After testing the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, I can confidently say it accomplished its purpose! I felt so reassured as I was listening to the beautiful audio that was coming out of my earbuds, that I could also pay attention to my environment if necessary. Even better, these are the most comfortable and lightweight feel earbuds I've owned. I will say I can wear them all day and not have an issue. The battery life is also good enough for me. After a full charge, I use them for 2-3 hours a day for about 5 days now and still don't need recharging. I recommend downloading the app for updates and to adjust settings such as the immersive sound feature.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AETWAVZQQD3X3CUUXVG7MFX5UYMQ,1,0,Color: Black,"March 28, 2024",2024-03-28,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

The look is very stylish. Not a good choice for you if you want to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the music. Bass isn‚Äôt received that well. Overall sound quality is good. A bit pricey for the overall experience.Upon getting the buds I felt that the case was a bit bulky. Especially compared to other brands and every other brand trying to slim down their deigns to fit the pocket more comfortably. I personally love that I can have them in-ear without being inside my ear. I have had issues with buds being inside my ear and my ear canals being differently sized that the provided adapters don‚Äôt suffice. I do not have this problem with these because they clam shell grip on your ear comfortably. It is a learning period to find out the proper places for yourself but once you find it, it‚Äôs great.I personally listen on full blast and you do get a decent sound experience, but it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúBOSE‚Äù amazing. Additionally it isn‚Äôt something you can‚Äôt get with other brands that are out there with their ‚Äúaware‚Äù or ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äútransparent‚Äù modes. What you are paying for here is for something that is in your ear without being inside your ear.

It took me many tries to update the buds and get them for my device to recognize them‚Ä¶but once I was in, it was in.These buds hold a decent charge and I have not had to charge them since opening and charging on day one and I‚Äôm about 1 week out. I do use them for short periods of time, SEVERAL times a day.These ear buds win for me with design and functionality while holding onto the ear and not being in the ear.These ear buds loose for me with sound quality and cost.I would still recommend these to others who want a different experience compared to traditional in ear buds.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AG4NBJI4I5JW3YJ7MQP2PKISJ42A,1,9,Color: White,"March 26, 2024",2024-03-26,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

My ears are small so this could be different for different ear sizes. The sound quality is premium and you can move it a bit to find the right spot for best sound.4) Immersive mode works perfectly and immersive still is my favorite while at home and Stereo is my favorite outdoors.5) Call quality is excellent. I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside6) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music. Also you can select the automatic sound level settings in the Bose Music App so that the sound is automatically increased in noisy environment so that your listening experience remains.7) Bose Music app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available however I liked the default setting, selecting immersive mode, playing a demo song so that you can wear the earbuds in different angles and hear which one gives you the best sound and comfort, pairing with other Bose devices, control volume, control songs (play next, previous etc).8) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life. Up to 7.5 hours of play time (up to 4.5 hours with Immersive Audio) and up to an extra 19.5 hours of battery life in the charging case.What can be improved:1) I have never owned a device like this and people who are ok in wearing earrings might appreciate this design. I might be ok with a transparent one or some color combination which doesn‚Äôt make it look like an earring.2) There should be some control on the part that goes inside the ear so that your push it down or adjust how deep it should go or rotate a bit to get the best sound position. Or the diameter of the cylindrical part which is behind the ear can be made adjustable. When I hold the earbud little bit downwards the bass is higher but when I remove my finger it comes back to the original position and the bass drops a bit.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2024",AGURXMD5HAZLH4GMSMPTCEOPF4IQ,1,16,Color: Black,"March 20, 2024",2024-03-20,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R38TE9N0OQM5P9,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars A Conversation Starting Beauty,Gabriel A. Martinez,4.0,"Be prepared to have conversations with everyone. The unique design of the Bose Ultra Open-Earbuds is not only super comfortable but also a head turner. Several conversations were sparked at work and the gym while wearing these. Having worn these for 5 hours straight at work, my ears hardly knew they the earbuds were on. I could have worn them longer had the battery not died. A 5-hour battery life is pretty good and a quick 45 min return to the charging case, they were at 100% battery power again without even plugging them into the wall (the case holds 3-4 charges). I only wish the case supported wireless charging but a very minor inconvenience considering how many charges it holds.Bose premium sound is as expected on these as well. Very deep rich bass is prominent and appreciated at lower volumes but evens out at higher volumes. The open ear design is made to continue naturally hearing the ambient sound around you. Meaning it is very easy to have a conversation at work or for safety reasons, enjoy music while still being aware of your surroundings. Keep in mind that this ambient sound is always present, there is no way to make these headphones block out the ambient noise. If that is a feature you are looking for, then these headphones may not be right for you. The immersive audio function is very creative and fun to use, especially while watching a movie. It simulates the sound source staying still while you might move about.Adjustments are easy through the Bose app. Unfortunately, this is where some minor frustrations come into play. The earbuds frequently disconnect from the app and require being put back into the case for 5-10 minutes in order to ‚Äúfully reset‚Äù and reconnect again. The headphones do remain connected to the sound source when this happens, and most adjustments can be made using the simple button presses on the earbuds themselves which do not require the app which is why I mention a ‚Äúminor inconvenience‚Äù. Speaking of button presses. It was very refreshing to have actual ‚Äúclick‚Äù buttons as opposed to the touch pads that I have had on other earbuds.

R3IYVFPD0487TQ,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to airpods pro gen 3 - a cyclist perspective,Avid Listener,5.0,"The ultra earbuds basically have one primary advantage which is the cuff. If you are worried about your earbud falling out of your ear, this is an innovative solution.- Not very tight, comfortable to wear. They did a good job finding the balance between being secure enough to bike with without turning into one of those paper binder clips. For the airpods, I always have used a cuff tether that runs around my neck. that's fine for preventing loss but it tends to become tangled in my helmet chinstrap. I've also gone running with my airpods only to watch one as it fell from my ear, to my knee and along the ground to a construction site 20 ft below the bridge I was on.- Helps with not turning your ear into a moist cave- You can hear things around you, because your ear canal isn't blocked, but, honestly, the pass through mode of airpods is just as good. Downside is that you're missing the sound dampening mode the airpods offers as well as noise cancellation which is non-existent with the Bose- Sound quality is fine - it can't compete with the air pods due to not covering your canal but it's good- Engineering is just ok - Apple nailed it with volume control on the side surface and their squeeze haptics are amazing. These have a button which is fine but feels like a weak second place. Want to turn the volume down, that's two button presses then hold the button down. That's hold the second button press down...not hold down after the second button press. Remember that when you are trying to catch a flight announcement in a foreign country and you're in a rush.- Bluetooth recognition is pretty slow and if you happen to screw something up where they lose connection (despite still playing audio the button just ceases to function) and you have to have the case handy to reset. Fine if i can stuff the case in a bike bag but if the battery life is all day, I shouldn't have to have the case nearby. I managed to break that connection within 15 minutes of playing around with them. So just don't do that. :)In the end, they are different use cases. Seems like most people have the airpods and, having three generations of them myself, I was struggling to justify an additional cash outlay. I've always lacked that exercise option, however, and I would like to not worry about dropping them under my airplane seat, so I might keep these.","Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2024",AGATT7JCHYWWO5RBLOJGM44F24AQ,1,4,Color: Black,"March 25, 2024",2024-03-25,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R1LCSMWZT1UNQG,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Ultra Open Earbuds - Amazing except for one thing,Paul,4.0,"I recently had the opportunity to experience the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, and they Definitely exceeded expectations. From the moment I unboxed them, the attention to detail and quality were evident, with the earbuds housed in a well-designed plastic charging case that added a touch of sophistication.Seamless Setup:Setting up the earbuds was a straightforward process. A quick download of the app and a few simple steps later, they were ready to be unleashed. The simplicity of the setup adds to the overall user-friendly experience.Comfort and Fit:The comfort level of the Ultra Open Earbuds is truly noteworthy. Once in my ears, they struck a perfect balance between being snug enough to stay in place during movement and not too tight to cause discomfort over time. This makes them an ideal choice for extended wear, whether during intense workouts, daily commutes, or casual listening sessions.Sound Quality Marvel:Bose's reputation for outstanding sound quality is well-maintained by the Ultra Open Earbuds. The audio spectrum is well-represented, with crisp highs, resonant lows, and a balanced midrange. The immersive audio experience adds a layer of richness to whatever you're listening to, making them suitable for various scenarios.Privacy in the Open:One standout feature is the open-ear design's ability to keep the audio experience private. Despite being 'open,' the earbuds manage to contain the sound effectively. This means that even at moderate to high volumes, those around you won't be privy to your musical choices or podcast preferences. It strikes a clever balance between situational awareness and personal audio enjoyment.Wireless Charging Absence:While the plastic charging case is durable and aesthetically pleasing, the notable absence of wireless charging capability might be a consideration for those who prioritize the utmost convenience in their daily lives.In conclusion, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds deliver on the promises of comfort, ease of use, and impressive sound quality. Their ability to keep your audio private even in an open-ear design adds a layer of practicality. Although the lack of wireless charging may be a minor drawback, it doesn't overshadow the overall positive experience these earbuds offer. For those seeking a harmonious blend of comfort, audio quality, and discreet listening, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are undoubtedly a strong contender in the market.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2024",AGZ7BJLOIXECSVYDW4HEDXBWUCSQ,1,6,Color: Black,"March 6, 2024",2024-03-06,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

R21PXTFVXN6LTP,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars A different concept for an IEM,metalmancpa1,4.0,"I have several different IEM's that I use for different purposes. The one feature none of them have is the natural open ear concept. All my other IEM's allow me to hear the outside world digitally (app or button). The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are truly open to the world, and to do that, how you wear them is very interesting. The way they wrap around the side of your ear to hold them in place is nothing I had ever seen before. Despite them not being inserted into the the ear to create a seal, they still sound very good, albeit the bass not as deep as a sealed IEM. That brings me to their purpose in my hands.My primary use for these will be exercise. If I'm running outside, they allow me to naturally hear the outside world, and the music sounds like they are coming from speakers outside my head. I think that's pretty cool. The app is solid, and the buttons on the IEMs are easy to use.There are two factors that led me to a 4/5 rating. One is the sound leakage. Unlike a sealed IEM, if I am sitting next to someone, they can hear the music. It may not be loud, but they can hear it. As such, in indoor instances, that could be an issue. The other reason is an unknown reason. There is the charging barrel attached to an extension that wraps around the ear so the part which emits the sound sits inside the crevice of the ear. The unknown is will the part that wraps around the ear hold up over continued use where you are stretching it each time you put into the ear.I really like the concept of these. I have others that sound better if I was just sitting listening to music, but I feel a lot more comfortable with these if I am outside running, on a bike, or even in a gym. Everything sound just as it is if I didn't have IEM's on.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2024",AFUMHFFBWB2MXY2FDW6OCBZWVTKA,1,2,Color: Black,"March 13, 2024",2024-03-13,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

TO THE REVIEW-Hello small ear community. If you have been wearing the bud lives for a few years like me- it's time to let go brother. These Bose are really an experience. It fits PERFECT better than you can imagine, the sound for me is honestly surreal. I'm not super duper into being an ""eq"" crybaby. I just want to be able to look another co-worker in the face and decide how much I actually want to pay attention to w.e they are talking about while still having the opportunity to listen easily if I want to, or tune it out.. Turn on immersive mode, have it on the ""still"" setting and play OUT OF MY HANDS BY FUTURE. And tell me you don't mf float like never before.INITIAL CONS: trying to keep it real for y'all.* I was really worried about the connection issue and I can confirm most of the issues come from the app being really really bad. I deleted it. TIP!!! download MUSIC SPEED CHANGER app for a much better eq adjusting experience.*OBVIOUSLY if your looking for noise cancelling idk what to say. They get super loud and with the music speed changer even louder.*Half volume on phone someone can hear the highs walking past or talking near you. Full volume someone could probably hear it a liiiiittle bit if they stood outside a door. 25% volume is perfect for pretending you care what people have to say.*Since I've gotten rid of the app no problems yet... Damn I can't think of anything else bad. They look cool to me, they fit perfect, they sound perfect, the battery is awesome, a couple updates and I couldn't see why they wouldn't be perfect if you adjust the eq to your liking.FINALE:: I was nervous and I told myself ""idgaf if they have ANY type of issue for 300 I swear to ___ I will return them"" somehow I ended up falling in love.

R1J6DA3NTD1FST,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Best For Open Ear Use,tamaraice16888,4.0,These Bluetooth earbuds are best to be worn the open ear style. They did not work out for me as an earbud and I was not able to figure out how to wear them as an on-ear headphone. I saw that they came with clips to wear them as an on-ear but I was not able to find any online and there was not any included in the Box. They are very comfortable as the clip on Style. I wore them all day and forgot that I even had them on sometimes while I was cleaning the house they did not shift or fall out and I was able to hear the room and what was going on around me while simultaneously listening to music and videos. They speak to you when an incoming phone call or text is coming in. There are a lot of functions that control and modify these earbuds on the app but I was never able to connect to the app after several tries I gave up because I simply didn't have the time to it everything. So I will not keep these. As a preference I like to be immersed in the sound so earbuds and headphones are for me but for someone who needs to hear what's going on around them maybe at the gym or at work these would be really great so I give a four-star rating.

I hate that you HAVE to have the case to be able to connect Bluetooth to anything. It‚Äôs SUPER hard to pair them, I will charge them, and then when I go to use them a day later. They will be dead after zero use. It‚Äôs unacceptable considering the case charges the ear buds themselves!These should never have been made. I want my money back.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these EVER to anyone.March 16 2024I am in love with these earbuds. I think they‚Äôre so comfortable. Probably my favorite thing about them is being able to hear what‚Äôs going on around me. Being a woman, when I‚Äôm walking outside with fully noise canceling earbuds in, at really any time of day, I have a fear that someone will sneak up on me. There‚Äôs plenty of crime podcasts that will make you not want to use noise canceling headphones while outside. But these Bose Ultra Open Earbuds allow me to hear the music very well, while still being aware of what‚Äôs going on behind me. I absolutely love that. These earbuds make safety a priority. I can see them being the future of earbuds in many scenarios such as, a new mom wanting to listen to music but also wanting to listen out for her baby during nap time. Or if the dogs are barking, or doorbell rings, someone says something to you in public and you don‚Äôt need to remove your earbuds to hear what they say. It‚Äôs super convenient.I will say, these haven‚Äôt been connecting to my iPhone as easily, or quickly as I have wanted. On a few occasions I couldn‚Äôt get them to connect at all, and then put them back in the case, start over and reconnected that way. And I have the app on my phone.Also the gray color isn‚Äôt that great. It would be cool if they came in different skin tone colors so they don‚Äôt stand out.

I thought, surely these don't fit into your ear, how could they, they don't come with any additional fittings?! On the contrary, what you see is what you get. Unlike other earbuds you've owned, these don't settle directly into your ear canal. Instead, they sit just outside of it, along your ear lobe.

I own a set of top-of-the-line Bose headphones that I use each and every day but they can be a nuisance, especially when I'm having to talk with my nurses or the staff at the clinic.

You can leave them on for many hours without having to take them off to adjust them. Once you get them into position, they stay put! Another thing I really love about them is unlike traditional earbuds, you won't have to worry about them getting dirty from wax in your ear. Think about it‚Ä¶how many times have you taken your earbuds off and looked at them with a wrinkled-up face because you have to clean them after having them in even for a short period?

The bonus to the way these clip to your ear- to me, this is much more secure. I like them when I'm out on a walk, or cleaning, I do not have to worry they will fall out and be lost or damaged. They are nice for listening to environmental noises on a walk and that if I do need to pause what I'm listening to, I do not have diminished hearing because my ear canal is open. That being said, I do not think they are the best for call quality. It's harder to hear calls and harder for the person on the phone to hear me. I find myself having to bend my ear so the speaker is closer. The are also not as private as an in the ear bud. If you are in a public setting- what you're listening to maybe be audible to people nearby. Because they do not fill your ear canal and block external sound, they do not work for me with noisy backgrounds like while vacuuming or using lawn tools.

RF2XEKZJYS22O,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars In Disbelief,Dan Velez,5.0,"Let's get something out of the way first - I've always had a kind of secret vendetta against earbuds. No matter the brand, shape, or promises of comfort, the never seemed to stay put, courtesy of what I can only assume is the peculiar architecture of my ears. So, naturally, when Bose rolled out their Ultra Open Earbuds, I approached them with a mix of skepticism and hope. Now picture this: me, giving these earbuds the kind of stress test that borders on ridiculous. We're talking a full-on, headbanging, wet dog impersonation level of rigor (yes, my neck is sore). Here's the kicker - besides some shifting along the curve of my ear (which doesn't really change the sound seal), they didn't fall out. Not even a little.It's almost as if Bose isn't just selling earbuds here but some kind of magic ear grips (and honestly, I'm not opposed to rebranding them as such).Yes, Bose wants you to download their Music app to get everything set up. Some might grumble, but let's be real, it's a one-and done- deal, and the payoff is worth it. After the initial setup, you're good to go unless you want to tweak settings, but why mess with perfection? Diving into the nitty-gritty, Bose has tinkered with the controls, offering a fresh take on volume adjustments that actually has me using it naturally. They threw in a couple of sound profile demos too, dubbed ""immersive audio"" modes. Between you and me, I couldn‚Äôt tell them apart, but that‚Äôs a moot point because the sound quality is crisp, clear, and just all-around fantastic, no matter where you are. Plus, they've introduced this auto volume feature that adjusts based on your environment. For a city dweller constantly bombarded by the symphony of urban chaos, this is a godsend.Wrapping this up, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are a game-changer. Not just because they‚Äôve managed to stay in my ears through activities that would make lesser earbuds quiver in fear, but because they've genuinely improved my listening experience. The mix of never-having-to-adjust comfort, sound quality, and smart features like auto volume adjustment, make these not just earbuds, but an essential part of my daily gear.

RQI2ALO0SC69H,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound and fit!,KK,5.0,"I have been around for a while and have called Silicon Valley home. I was a techie before the term existed. I am a music fanatic so when Bluetooth arrived on the scene in the late 90's I was an early adopter. They had only one ear, so no stereo, and were for mobile phone conversations but you could listen to low-quality music as well. Then came some bulky headphones that sounded terrible and would not stay connected. The first all-day usable version was the kind that hung around your neck with wired buds that went to your ears. They sounded decent and had a big battery so I wore them nearly constantly and have been using one form or another of Bluetooth audio ever since. I have had probably twenty-five different pairs of headsets and now buds over the years. I was using two top-of-the-line versions when I decided to try these new Ultra Open Earbuds from Bose. I had one pair of in-ear for noise reduction and one over the ear for sports, working out, or anything where I was moving around and didn't want to lose a bud. I have lost a lot of buds over the years. But back to Bose, anyone who follows technology and sound knows that Bose makes great products and this is not my first purchase from this groundbreaking company. And these new buds support this great legacy. They are a new design as far as I know, I have not seen open earbuds before. Unless you count the bone conducting technology that I have tried and found the sound quality to be lacking. These new buds wrap around the cartilage of your ear and do not fall off even during strenuous activity. And they leave your ear canal open to take in your surroundings. No more having to take a bud out to hear or talk to someone which is great when I am around other people. They are very comfortable to wear all day but you may have to find the right part of your ear to wear them for optimal comfort. And the sound... the sound is brilliant, just what you would expect from Bose. I was wondering if there would be the famous Bose low ends and they do not disappoint. Five Stars, great product!

Really impressed with the durability and flexibility of the earbud.This great experience does come with some opportunities:I noticed when I took the earbuds off to place in the case my music was still playing and didn't autostop.Also with no noise cancelling - the call was able to hear back ground sounds and also experienced a slight echo sound on calls.This is a really great product that is now my new favorite by Bose. The Ultra Bose Earbuds is definitely a conversation piece when noticed by others that I've been able to share my wonderful musical experience!

R2CECIY8BP83VY,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Sleek look!!!,Makayla Walker,4.0,"The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, to me, are good for joggers, kids, and anyone that need to be aware of their surroundings. You are able to hear very clearly while wearing the earbuds; you can hear sounds in the background. No noise cancelation. Personally, I love the bass and great sounds, so I prefer the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. However, everyone is different. Play Controls: - To cut the volume up, hold the right button - To cut the volume down hold, the Left button - To play or answer calls, push the left earbud once. - To skip forward or cancel a call, hit the left earbud button twice. - To go back, hit the left button three times - You can activate the auto button inside the app that will adjust the volume according to your surroundings. One downside is that the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds does not have wireless charging, but that's ok. These earbuds hold a 5 to 6 hour charge, and you can recharge in the charging case for up to 24 hours of listening time. Also, you can do a quick charge, and this will allow you to have up to 2 hours of listening time in about 30 minutes. Battery life and charge cycles vary, depending on how you utilize them. I love the Bose Music app, which allows you to adjust the music settings, create listening modes, modify settings, and more. And I love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds because they were designed for complete openness to your surroundings. Great job, Bose. Job well done.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2024",AGFR6B3LOYLOS4YJRLDXR6XOC3OA,1,1,Color: Black,"March 6, 2024",2024-03-06,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

R8S3BJ6CBF650,B0CPFV77W4,3.0 out of 5 stars Super poor talking microphone,louie,3.0,"Music:You can use the left and right independently, a huge plus. You have to adjust the speaker in your ear as close as you can to your ear canal to get good sound. They are as advertised open so you can hear the music and surrounds. Not to much to say besides don't expect super great quality as you would from in ear earbuds but or sounds good enough.Call quality:Iet me put it this way you can get better call quality from earbuds that released 8 years ago. They're that bad! Bose always seems to come up short in the call quality in the microphone for some reason in earbuds. You sound like you are talking in a tunnel, idk I am going to wait for the gen 2 or until Bose decides to stop buying microphones from the dollar store.Battery:Not much to say besides it depends on if you use both ears and you will get 8 hrs if you use one ear at a time then you can extend the battery even longer.Comfort:These are comfortable for the most part but there is a snug feeling to them that you have to get a custom to. They take a while to get the feel of them. At first I caught myself wearing them maybe 2 to 3 hrs before my outside of my ears got sore from the snug fit. But I feel if I would of been more patient at the same time I could of got longer duration.Overall:I had to return them, I wanted more the complete bundle when I get earbuds.. The call quality was so bad all they are used for is listening to music. For that much you might as well spend another 150 and get the bose Ultra Headphones and get the complete package just my opinion. I am going to wait for the gen 2 to see if bose actually fixes the mic in call quality.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AF3UXYQTGC6NKW7KMJQOWRPHZ2BA,1,4,Color: White,"May 2, 2024",2024-05-02,2024-05,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

The comfort - after an hour or two they start to make my ear feel a little pinched. Sound - it's very good but would be a lot better if the 'peg' that goes in the ear were made for a little shallower ear. The speaker on my buds seems to be aimed not 'into' my ear hole but rather toward the side of my face, no matter how much I adjust them. The mic quality is dubious. The controls, app, and bluetooth connectivity are all very good - as I have come to expect from Bose. I like these buds quite a bit but I wish they were slightly more comfortable-effective for my ear. If they were $100 I would probably overlook any quibbles, but at more than double that price ...

I normally wear one at a time when I‚Äôm at home so that I can always stay focused on my children. I have worn them to sleep.

I've used them for 2 weeks as my work headphones for all my Zoom meetings. I easily spend 6 or more hours in meetings a day. I was surprised that the battery lasts 3-4 days with heavy use. The strange thing was that the battery was at 100% for 3 days, then it said it was 60% and within 30 mins of use it dropped to 0%. So now I end up charging it when it gets below 70%. They are quite comfortable even with long hours of wear. In an indoor office setting they are loud enough but at max volume they are not blaringloud. In outdoor/car settings I felt they were too quiet even at full volume and i had trouble hearing full conversions in Zoom meetings. I have them paired to my work laptop and to my phone. They retain which device they last paired to and automatically connect. They also announce the name of the device when you put the ear piece in your ear. I love Bose sound quality, but these are not the right buds if you want full noise canceling super high volume music playback.

Comfortable for extended wear: Designed to be worn all day, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds offer exceptional comfort, allowing users to use them without discomfort or ear fatigue.2. Enhanced grip for active lifestyles: With a secure grip, these earbuds are suitable for various activities like running and exercise, ensuring they stay in place even during vigorous movements.3. Ambient sound awareness: Unlike traditional earbuds, the open-ear design of the Ultra Open Earbuds allows users to remain aware of their surroundings at all times, enhancing safety during outdoor activities or when working in environments where awareness is crucial.4. Long battery life: Enjoy extended listening sessions with the Ultra Open Earbuds thanks to their impressive battery life, providing hours of uninterrupted music.5. Bass performance: It is unfair to expect great bass in an open earbud concept, but these small open earbuds pack a surprising amount of bass. I haven't seen such punchy bass in any other open earbuds or clips.6. Intuitive controls: The earbuds feature easy-to-use controls, allowing users to adjust settings and navigate their music effortlessly throughout the day.7. Desing: these are undoubtedly cool-looking earbuds. The smaller case design adapted by Bose in this version is particularly noteworthy; moving away from their traditional clunky cases.Cons:1. Lack of multipoint connectivity: Ultra Open Earbuds do not support multipoint connectivity, limiting their versatility for users who frequently switch between devices. This may not be a big con for many.2. Absence of wireless charging: Again a minor con given how fast they charge when connected with a cableTakeaway:Despite some minor limitations, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are an excellent choice for individuals leading an active lifestyle or those who prefer to maintain awareness of their surroundings while enjoying music.

Still...I spend most of my day working remotely and also have a little part time job outside so I need something comfortable for long hours of use. And I'm a budget audiophile so need excellent sound quality for a reasonable price. I've gone through 8 different earbuds looking for both. Because of some surgery my ear canal is very small so any regular buds don't fit. I don't like the sound quality of the bone conduction phones I've tried. So when I saw these I said what the hell.The price is a bit on the high side so I wouldn't compromise on fit or sound. Once you figure out how to wear these you'll quickly forget your wearing them, they're that comfortable. As for sound quality? They're the closest I've found anywhere from any vendor to the quality of my Nose Quiet Comfort over ear headphones. Admittedly the drivers here are very small so they can't match the quality exactly, but theyre 8 out of 10. Ultra HD, Atmos, and Bose Immersive Sound are all supported. After a full days work or shift I'm ready to just kick back after dinner with a music playlist. The headphones don't come out nearly as often any more.Don't let the price scare you.

R1KE2W94ULX3QB,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and Great looking.,Christine  Rumbold,4.0,"When I saw these open earphones, I was intrigued by the idea because my worst gripe about my Galaxy Buds is that I have to pause the music or remove the earphone to be able to hear people talking to me. In addition, I have small ear canals and most earbuds (I‚Äôve tried nearly every brand) tend to fall out or just hurt my ears. The sound is great (as I would expect from Bose), very crisp cand clear. I work on a computer all day and enjoy listening to podcasts or music and don‚Äôt want to bother my coworkers, so comfort for 8 hours is a must. After about 6 hours I started to feel them and by 8, while they didn‚Äôt hurt, they started for a little uncomfortable. I had to adjust the way they were on my ears as the would move my earring to an uncomfortable position. However, over all I would give these a thumbs up as the stayed connected to my phone all day, I was able to have conversations without having to pause or remove them and when I walked away from my desk the connection range was impressive. I liked the fact that I actually had to click a button to pause them (my hair tends to pause or disconnect most, or an accidental touch to move my hair).

Comfort was my primary concern, especially for those long office hours, and these earbuds have truly delivered on that front. Even after hours of wear, I hardly notice they're there, making them perfect for extended use during workdays. For office days, these earbuds are an absolute game-changer. Their open design allows me to remain aware of my surroundings while still enjoying my music or taking calls. Whether it's conversing with colleagues or tuning in to virtual meetings, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds seamlessly blend into my work routine. I was pleasantly surprised by their performance during outdoor activities as well. Recently, while working on my car's brakes, I wore them, and they didn't interfere with my tasks at all. Their ability to deliver both music and important ambient sounds made maintenance tasks a breeze. The standout feature of these earbuds is undoubtedly their open design. Unlike traditional earbuds that seal off your ears, these sit comfortably on the outer ear, offering a unique balance between audio immersion and environmental awareness. They're ideal for activities like jogging or cycling, where being attuned to your surroundings is crucial. Connectivity and functionality are seamless with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds. Pairing them with my iPhone 14 was effortless, especially since I already had the Bose Music app installed for my Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar. The touch controls on the earbuds are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls. Battery life is impressive, offering up to 8 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. With the included charging case providing an additional 16 hours, I never have to worry about running out of power while on the move. The only downfall I could find is the current retail price. If you're not a hurry, I would wait for the holidays when these are surely going to be discounted some. Looking forward to continuing using these and putting them to test further.

I‚Äôll keep it short, for open earbuds, meaning no noise cancelling: meant to hear the world around you & your music in private. They‚Äôre not bad, they sound great, look great almost like earrings & feel great. They last about 7hrs if you listen to it below 80 decibals, which is probably around 70% volume or less. It‚Äôs even less with immersion mode on, almost half the time. When outside in moderate traffic & weather conditions. I use the earbuds between 60-80% volume, depending on my mood. Anything higher & you‚Äôll obviously hear it with no problem. There is a slight sound leak if in a quiet place. They sound amazing considering they‚Äôre not inside your ear. The immersion mode is alright. I personally think it reduces the sound quality, so I turn it off. They‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget they‚Äôre even on. I use them for about 8-10hrs. After about 6/7hrs, my ears were getting tired & I was feeling a slight discomfort, so I alternated. They stay on pretty well, I shook my head vigorously & they stayed on still. When I take off my sweater or put my hair up. There‚Äôs a 80% chance they‚Äôre gonna fall off, only if it gets caught on something though. The bad: it doesn‚Äôt have multi point connectivity & no wireless charging. So for me definitely not worth $300.

I love that I can wear these all day. Sometimes I just have to put my finger on my ear to make sure I have them on.

R1PC7B7P5FHCN4,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Great open earbuds,Maddenone,5.0,"I've been looking for a device that would allow me to hear surrounding conversations while still listening to music. Surprisingly, I've found this with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds. I usually don't take to earbuds because 1) they often cancel out external noise, and 2) they don't fit comfortably in my ears. The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds resolved both issues. They fit snugly onto the rims of my ear without pinching and they do not block external sounds, so I can still carry on full conversations even with soft music playing in the earbuds. The product comes with a magnetized charging case that lights up yellow to show that the earbuds need charging and white to show they are fully charged. The pairing process is also quick and easy. I really like that I can accept calls and end calls by pressing the button on either earbuds. What I've learned after using the earbuds for a few days is that I needed to wear both buds to have a normal phone conversation. Having only one earbud on causes a ""fading in and out"" effect to the listener on the other end. In addition, having ""Immersive Sound"" on quickly drains the battery, to the point where you'd have to charge the earbuds every few hours. Fortunately, the sound quality is excellent even with the immersive sound off. A few drawbacks to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are: 1) You have to remove one of them to comfortably use your work phone, 2) There is a higher risk of losing them than with headphones. It takes conscious effort on my part to ensure I do not misplace them and to ensure I properly charge them every night. 3) While the earbuds do sit snugly on your ear rims, they can still be tugged off by a hair brush, or even your hand if you're not careful. Having said all this, I've thoroughly enjoyed my Bose Ultra Open Earbuds so far. The sound quality is phenomenal, the design is slick, the fit is comfortable, the product is easy to use and the ability to listen and carry on conversations even with the earbuds on are all great selling points.

The design allows for a snug fit on your ear without causing any discomfort, even when lying down on your side. This game-changer is for those who enjoy listening to music or taking calls while relaxing or resting. For non-active noise-canceling headphones, this has great call sound quality.The secure fit of these earbuds ensures that they stay in place during various activities, providing a worry-free experience for users on the move. Whether you're exercising, commuting, or simply going about your day, the Earbuds stay securely on your ears. The only drawback to these Earbuds is that they are fitting for different ear types. A couple of my family members with bigger ears (ear lobes) had difficulties finding a secure fitting for the headphones during our testing.Battery life is always a crucial factor for any wireless earbuds, and Bose delivers on this front. During our testing, it let me enjoy over 7 hours of my favorite music, numerous calls, and making voice notes in various apps, without constantly worrying about recharging.Now, let's talk about the sound quality ‚Äì it's nothing short of superior. Bose has a reputation for delivering premium audio experiences, and these Earbuds are no exception.

So don't buy these expecting noise cancelling like most modern earbuds, as these are not meant for that.The immersion mode is also great as it makes it sound like I'm surrounded by sound rather it being next to my ears.I give these a 4 out of 5 simply because #1 the price is too high, and #2 i wish there was a noise cancelling silicone attachment or something for the very few times i do want to block out the world without having to use my Bose noise cancelling headphones for that. Other than that these are excellent earbuds for the use cases listed above and I'm sure there are many more!","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2024",AHE7J62QFN5QIQII2Q6N5KXIN5ZQ,1,0,Color: Black,"March 20, 2024",2024-03-20,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

RXSXY06OJ2OVB,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Quality and Sound,Jason S,5.0,"I really love the Bose Ultra Open-Ear Buds. Right away I thought they might be uncomfortable, but I was wrong. They fit nicely ""hugging"" your ear without discomfort. I would wear other ear buds and worry that they would fall out. But with these, I haven't had that issue.First, out of the box, you will notice that the case feels like a quality material. You'll also get a USB-A to USB-C charging cable. You'll want to download the Bose app so that you can properly set up your ear buds. Once it's set up, be prepared for that awesome Bose sound. For not being inside your ear, the sound is nice and crisp, yet if you needed to hear something outside of that, you still can. I thought people around you will also heat what you are listening to, but that's not the case. The spatial sound gives you the impression that you're listening to your music through standard speakers in your home. So when you turn your head, it sort of sounds like you have speakers in a fixed location.The fit and finish looks like it's very well made. I had used them for several hours and they just kept going. So far, I haven't had the battery die on me during use. I've gone several days before charging them when my other ear buds would die on me after a few hours and needed another charge. Charging these ear buds didn't take long at all and were ready before I knew it. I really like the fact that you don't feel them after a while and forget you have them in.The ear buds have a button on top that has different functions whether you press once, twice, three times or hold. You can answer your calls, skip tracks, or change the volume.I've owned many other premium ear buds, but so far these are my favorite now. I own many other Bose speakers around my home but never had an opportunity to own Bose ear buds. I really love their quality and fit and finish of their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2024",AHXYBIMYACXKXXZO5BFDK7WZ25ZA,1,0,Color: Black,"March 18, 2024",2024-03-18,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)
R39BJIG86M1MTJ,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Great open earbuds for runners,psnick,5.0,"I'm an avid runner and have been relying on my Apple AirPods Pro 2 in transparency mode for awareness of my surroundings during runs. Transparency mode is fantastic, but due to my ear shape, I've had an issue with the AirPods sometimes falling out, even with foam tips. I decided to see if the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds might be a better option for me when running. After about three weeks of use including a half-marathon race, I couldn't be happier with this product. They are very comfortable on my ears and have never come close to falling off during my runs. Sound quality is comparable to the AirPods Pro 2 in quiet environments. In loud environments -- for example, when there is other loud music playing or when you're running on a road that has a lot of traffic -- you won't be able to hear much of anything through the Bose earbuds. That's perfectly fine for me, because I want to hear what's happening around me when I'm running, even at the expense of not being able to hear what's playing. I have had no bluetooth connection or loss-of-sync issues so far. So I would highly recommend the Bose ultra open earbuds to those who want a uniquely secure fit during active movement and are seeking to prioritize awareness of surroundings over audibility of content.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AFYJIKO3TLWDLZBNKOHKQWRMB6VA,1,3,Color: Black,"May 28, 2024",2024-05-28,2024-05,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

When running, they ‚Äúbounce‚Äù up and down and give the sensation of tugging on the ear. It‚Äôs not painful and they wont fall out, but it‚Äôs very annoying and distracting. I think to fix this the headphones either need to weigh less or have some sort of adjustability on the piece that wraps behind the ear (to allow for a more secure ‚Äúclamp‚Äù on the ear). These are very much ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù earbuds - so I think the experience will vary from person to person. For all the reviews saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll forget you have them on‚Äù, I found the exact opposite to be true.

R3E36NP8IQMOVI,B0CPFV77W4,4.0 out of 5 stars Smallest range bluetooth device I've ever owned,Jocelyn,4.0,"Used these for about 2 hours and was happy with them until I tried to swap to a different device and also tested the range.I walked 5 steps away from the device that these were connected to, and all the sound cut out. Then when I walked back to where I'd left the device, reconnecting was a hassle (had to fully unpair, otherwise it would only connect voice and not audio). This happened both with an iPhone and when trying to connect with PC.Sound quality is about what I'd expect, and they're pretty comfortable. But even if there's no physical wire, you're on a tether of maybe 2 feet regardless (unless mine are just faulty). This is ok for phone use, but half the appeal of bluetooth headsets for me is that I can connect them to my computer as well and walk around without being tethered to my desk but still being able to hear. For the $300 price tag, I am super disappointed in the short range.UPDATE: May actually have just been an issue with switching between devices, and Bluetooth multipoint not performing well. Bumping up to 4 stars since this isn't as big of an issue for me; probably just can only use them with one device at a time.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2024",AFSFRZBAIY2LH5EY7H3Q6VJWX5XQ,1,1,Color: Black,"March 7, 2024",2024-03-07,2024-03,Apple,Apple AirPods (4th Generation)

Let me break down my experience:1. Design and Comfort: The design is sleek and modern, and the comfort level caught me by surprise. Unlike other earbuds that tend to irritate my ear canal, these rest comfortably on the rim of my ear. No more fidgeting or adjusting due to itching or discomfort.2. Sound Quality: As a music enthusiast, sound quality matters to me. These earbuds deliver! The audio is crisp, and the bass response is impressive. The best part? It‚Äôs a Bose product, so you know you‚Äôre getting top-notch sound. Plus, the customizable equalizer allows me to fine-tune the audio to match my preferences.3. Perfect for Active Lifestyles: Whether I‚Äôm walking or working out, these earbuds immerse me in my music. The ambient noise doesn‚Äôt intrude, allowing me to enjoy my playlist while still being aware of my surroundings. It‚Äôs the ideal balance.4. No Noise Reduction During Calls: My only minor gripe is that I wish they had noise reduction during phone calls. The microphones tend to pick up everything when I‚Äôm outside. A feature to minimize background noise during calls would be a great addition.5. Gift-Worthy: I‚Äôve recommended these to friends who dislike earbuds that sit inside the ear canal. They‚Äôre perfect for older folks too. And speaking of gifts, I‚Äôm getting a few pairs for my friends‚Äîthey deserve the comfort and quality.Additional Highlights:Comfort: I‚Äôve worn them for hours without any discomfort or heaviness. o User-Friendly Buttons: The buttons behind the ear are easy to configure and use.Quick Setup: Scanning the QR code made setup a breeze.Flexible Listening: Use either the left or right side, and swap when the battery runs low. Brilliant!In summary, these earbuds should definitely be on your gift or wish list. They combine comfort, sound quality, and thoughtful features seamlessly.

The open-ear design is really convenient for my open office space, allowing me to remaining aware of my surroundings. This is particularly useful during outdoor runs, especially if you have to use the street like me. The sound quality is impressive for earbuds that don't sit directly in the ear canal, with clear highs and decent bass. They're comfortable to wear and stay secure during even the craziest workout (jump rope, burpees, you name it). The battery life is more than enough, easily lasting through several days on a single charge. The only issues I've had with the earbuds are some issues staying connected to my work computer (which I'm sure could be fixed with an update or resetting my connection) and the fact that there's no wireless charging for the case.

I‚Äôve used these to listen to various genres of music, taken Zoom and phone calls, and even use them for gaming. Before receiving these, I worried the bass would be subpar due to having no seal with the ear, but boy was I wrong.

The open ear design is definitely unique, and I love being able to hear what‚Äôs going on around me in the office at work and while at home.Additionally, the immersive audio is truly an experience and I would argue it‚Äôs actually better than other products on the market. Overall, I give these a A+ and have already recommended them to friends and family. They may not be for everybody If you plan on using these in loud environments, or want an interrupted listening experience, but that‚Äôs not as much as a flaw as a feature of the design.

R3J07BPHTT5J96,B0B1NGPY94,3.0 out of 5 stars As annoying as the othe rPixel products,Colby,3.0,"My main issue with these is that they are designed where the center of mass is too high, so your ear canal needs to seriously grip the silicone eartip (hard enough to hurt after a while) for the buds to have the slightest chance of staying in your ears while moving or talking or chewing.You can‚Äôt change or individually disable the physical controls for pause/play/skip/ANC/volume, which is a huge oversight when at least one is going to activate basically every time you insert or adjust your earbuds, since the only place you can push them in by is the pressure sensitive button... very annoying. On top of that, you have to deal with the unstoppable transparency toggling on and off separately for each earbud the whole time (so you have no idea if it‚Äôs actually sealed in your ear or still falling out). The ovoid shape and frictionless material make them unideal to wrestle out of the case‚Äôs magnetic grip as well, and VERY easy to drop.I haven‚Äôt had a great experience with my other Google ‚ÄúPixel‚Äù products, constantly feeling like I‚Äôm a beta tester for features too half-baked to return at all in the next iteration (or often even function in the first place), but these were the highest appraised earbuds for Android in my price range. I originally had the first gen of Nothing buds, and those were great until the right one barely charged and eventually gave out completely. These have metal contacts that face inward while you wear them, so they inevitably will catch some of the oil from your skin and not charge when they should, leading you to spend a minute or two carefully cleaning the metal charging contacts every single time you put them away, so I expect it's only a matter of time before these stop charging as well.Noise cancellation is acceptable, sound is acceptable after modifying the equalizer, battery life is several hours with ANC on, and they do charge wirelessly. Are they really 16x better than a set of regular wired earbuds though? or 4x better than cheap wireless buds? Maybe for the noise cancellation, and that's a big maybe.","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024",AEWEI6VL6AQQJ77EPELXQRQV4GSQ,1,1,Color: Charcoal,"June 26, 2024",2024-06-26,2024-06,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

R2IPUU9GZ4WWJ4,B0B1NGPY94,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great features, comfort, battery, and controls. Not great sound.",Dana,3.0,"The features on this tws iem are the best in class:-Skin-touch controls so you're not accidentally pressing with pillows, or having to push hard on your ears. The controls are definitely the best of any tws I've ever used, and this should be the new standard in the industry. Swipe for volume, tap for calls/play, double tap for skip/hang up, and long press to swap between anc/transparency.-""Hello Google"" works better on these than any other tws I've used, for whatever reason.-Switch only between anc and transparency modes, so you don't need to wait for slow transitions.-Ultra lightweight, has no mass so it can't ever gain momentum to fall out of your ears. Plus, extremely comfortable.-Great battery life compared to others. At the start of my 10hr work day to the end I only need to put them in the charging case for about 5 minutes one time. They recharge FAST.-Strong signal never has dicey connection. I can go about 60 feet away from my phone with these and not lose signal at all. (Any other tws bud is like 10feet.)The ANC and transparency modes-The ANC is interesting, because they're a pretty ""open"" iem so when the battery is dead they let in a lot of the world around you.. but they do a good job canceling noise coming in regardless of low passive isolation. It's usually not as good as a strong earplug, or an ear protection over an iem, but it is still extremely nice.It tends to drown out only the low end of some sounds, like if a white noise is playing you'll still hear all of the high pitch portion. This kind of makes sounds more annoying sometimes rather than making them less annoying even when they're overall lower volume.Transparency mode is super nice, but it doesn't allow you to change the strength of this mode as some other manufacturers do. Google did a good job making it sound natural but without volume control it doesn't do a good enough job of allowing you to hear as well as without them in. Things are still just slightly too quiet with this mode on.Mic and call quality, BT delays-The mics sound fantastic. Listening back to myself sounds incredible. Hardly any compression. Still picks up lots of outside noise but not as bad as most tws.Despite the amazing microphone(s), calls have the nefariously annoying delay. Both when you hear someone and when you speak. Enough to where people notice..This delay is also present when gaming and watching videos. YouTube and major video players will add a delay to synch it and it works great but in competitive games it's really bad.So, even though the BT signal is super strong (and the AAC is a lot less battery intensive! Which is probably the reason they chose it.) If you need a FAST signal then you have to look elsewhere.Luckily, most of us don't actually need a fast signal and I'd 100% take this minor delay over increased battery usage.There's a lot more about the features I could say, but in short I love them. If you're just looking for something light and comfortable (seriously, way way way more comfortable than any other tws out there! Very easy to sleep in and wear all day compared to others!) Then these are great..But.. I must now talk about something very important, and the reason they lose two stars despite all the love I have for them: Sound quality.GOOGLE YOU NEED TO FIRE SOMEONE OVER THIS. Holy biscuits, talk about some of the worst sounding iems above $30 I've ever heard (I've had a couple hundred..)There are no highs. These are what is known as ""dark."" Anything above 10khz is bland sounding.. so anything fun frequency, or with distortion, or anything.. just sounds bad.They sound okay at first because the bass and mids are alright but there is no balance when you get to the highs. They absolutely ruin any electronic or post 80's rock. I'd take most gas station buds over these for technical listening.But, I think that's what Google was going for: a vocal-centric bud for daily function over musical quality.They nailed the spatial side of audio; the driver placement is perfect for diffuse field and phase generation. And there is even a nice dynamic feeling from bass on the weighty driver.If only the driver had a bit stronger magnet so it could move a little faster, or maybe it literally just needed to be tuned better.. it's just bad at making high frequency sounds and it totally ruins all critical music listening.So, overall, I love the set for work. Audiobooks/podcasts/calls/battery/controls/comfort are all top notch 10/10.But what the heck was Google thinking releasing it with such horrible tuning? Give me 20 minutes with their tuner and they'd have a top of the line product here. It's disgusting what they've done..Maybe they don't think people actually care about the sound of their music. And honestly, they're probably right.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2022",AFWSEZH6RQY3BRDQW4TTK4XSLCFQ,1,195,Color: Lemongrass,"August 15, 2022",2022-08-15,2022-08,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

RMLQBN2QK3G5W,B0B1NGPY94,4.0 out of 5 stars Google Pixel Buds Pro: The first android bluetooth earbuds I've actually enjoyed using,Tacatshi Purrakami,4.0,"As a tech enthusiast with a penchant for audio quality, I was eager to get my hands on the Pixel Buds Pro. After a month of testing, here's my honest review:First Impressions:Pulling them out of the slick white case, the Pixel Buds exude a premium vibe. The minimalist design of the case and the earbuds is a big step up from my previous sony earbuds, and the matte finish feels comfortable and secure in my ears. Pairing them with my Pixel 8 Pro was a breeze, thanks to Google's magic sauce of Fast Pair.Sound Quality:The sound quality is where the Buds truly shine. They deliver crisp, clear audio with rich bass and balanced mids and highs. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is surprisingly effective, blocking out most ambient noise without sacrificing audio fidelity. Transparency mode is equally impressive, allowing me to hear my surroundings without taking the Buds out.Call Quality:The call quality is excellent. My voice comes across clearly on the other end, even in noisy environments. The Beamforming technology effectively isolates my voice, reducing background noise and ensuring clear communication. Google has also rolled out subsequent software updates to improve audio quality and it's noticeable. Google IMO is now an industry leader in this area.Features:The Pixel Buds Pro are packed with useful features, including:Adaptive Sound: Automatically adjusts the volume based on your surroundings.Touch Controls: Easy-to-use gestures for controlling playback, volume, and ANC.Google Assistant Integration: Access your Assistant with a simple voice command.Multipoint Connection: Seamlessly switch between devices without disconnecting.Battery Life:The battery life is decent, with the Buds lasting up to 7 hours with ANC on and up to 11 hours with it off but of course I wish it was double the battery length. The case provides an additional 20 hours of charging, which is enough to keep me powered through the day.Fit and Comfort:The fit is secure and comfortable, thanks to the included ear tips in various sizes. I wore them for extended periods without any fatigue or discomfort.Overall:The Google Pixel Buds Pro are a compelling option for tech-savvy individuals who prioritize sound quality, features, and seamless integration with the Google ecosystem. Worth the cost and always recommend checking the reburbished options on amazon.Pros:Excellent sound quality with rich bass and balanced mids and highsEffective ANC and Transparency modeClear call qualityPacked with useful featuresSecure and comfortable fitCons:Price might be high for someBattery life could be betterVerdict:4.5 out of 5 stars.

The Sonys win hands down on noise canceling. I use buds when I mow the lawn and the Sonys were excellent at blocking that noise, the PBPs not that great.Here's what makes me give the PBPs 4 stars: I left them in a jacket pocket (in the case) and they went through the wash. When I realized where they were, I found them out of the case mixed with the now clean clothes. I figured they were ruined for sure.

I can connect to 2 devices at once, but I have to disconnect completely from device 2 in order to get audio on device 1 again. Kind of defeats the purpose, but it is what it is. I do like the noise cancellation. That does work well. That is night and day just entering into your own world. It's not perfect, but will be used. The latest update brought conversation detection. That is also hit and miss, but maybe just needs to be adjusted. If you sing to music, the music stops. I guess that's as intended, so no big deal. Another cool thing is auto EQ. Auto EQ is hit and miss, but getting better. It really depends on your audio source location. EQ doesn't help if it's low quality audio. I haven't used the hearing protection feature yet, so I can't really comment on it. Battery is also mixed. I used both for about an hour, down to 81%. Not terrible by any means, but that will fall well short of the estimated 31 hours. I'm guessing I still need to adjust a few settings.

RKY5G6XGLEEHP,B0B1NGPY94,2.0 out of 5 stars NOT for music - poor sound quality and then some,DiscriminaTor,2.0,"Do you like high-quality sound ? Then do NOT buy these- they make music sound very muddy and muffled. Maybe if you're used to blasting tunes through the smartphone speakers, this could be considered an upgrade in quality, but otherwise no. I ended up returning these and buying Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro and the difference in sound quality couldn't be any more drastic- even without using LDAC codec (pixel buds Pro only support AAC- more on that later). It was like going from FM radio to a CD. Anyway, this isn't a review of Anker, so moving on...Overall, pixel buds Pro are a massive letdown with half baked design/engineering, and worst of all- VERY poor sound quality. A beta product at best (at least some consistency here from Google and its Beta Universe of Beta Everything). If you're mainly using them for zoom or voice calls, listening to podcasts, etc they might do the trick, but so will a $50 set of buds. But if you intend to use them for listening to music, they simply don't deliver- certainly not for a hefty $150-200 price tag.No amount of EQ tweaking could bring any quality/clarity to the music, albeit the available EQ settings are very rudimentary- just the 5 fixed frequency ""sliders"" (but without actual frequencies/Hz even being indicated) plus a handful of presets.The EQ and other controls worked very well on a Pixel phone as did the Bluetooth pairing- a really slick pairing experience, actually. However, when I tried installing the Pixel Buds app on a NON-Pixel Android 13 phone, it didn't show any of the controls (the app basically didn't work), so YMMV on any device that's not a Google's own phone.The other downside to the app is the very limited configuration options and settings for customizing the touch controls- can not adjust touch sensitivity or just simply disable the touch function (the buds constantly register ""touch"" when they're merely being adjusted and perform random actions as a result).After a couple of days playing with these, I noticed the buds' batteries will drain from just sitting. There is no way to actually turn them off other than by returning into the charging case and closing it (triple tap no longer works). Seriously, Google- a $200 headphone set that is too dumb to not turn itself off when not in use! Or is it too ""Apple"" for you to actually have the buds turn off automatically when they're removed from one's ears, especially considering that all necessary sensors and HW are already there anyway and the headphones ""know"" when they're inserted and removed? At least offer a configurable sleep timer/power save mode- like virtually every gadget on the planet has.Speaking of Apples, while the buds- ostensibly designed for Pixel and Android phones- support Apple's (defacto) AAC codec of all things(!), they lack support for any higher quality codecs, such as Qualcomm Apt-x, Aptx-LL, or Sony's LDAC. If I wanted headphones that are ""married"" to Apple and its AAC, I might've as well bought Airpods Pro or Bose...As there is no way to adjust touch sensitivity or disable the touch function, the buds end up doing random things (play, skip, toggling ANC) while I'm simply adjusting them for better fit. Perhaps on/off functionality would be helpful here too, so that I may first adjust the fit before actually turning them on. And seeing how they automatically turn on when removed from the case, this becomes yet another source of battery drain, should I for whatever reason just put them aside. To avoid battery drain they must be returned to the case every time- no alternatives here. Seems like Apple's ""philosophy"", i.e. ""we've already decided what's best for you and how you should use your device, so we won't give you any options"". Again, if I wanted the vendor dictate how I use my devices, I might as well buy Apple products... Don't we all use Google/Android products because they allow(ed) flexibility instead of forcing the user into doing things as the vendor decided is the ""best"" (and the only) way ?Fit- while this is subjective, I could never get them to fit securely, despite trying different size ear tips (hence the need for adjustments which wreaked havoc with the touch interface). The buds always felt somewhat loose, albeit that loose fit made them comfortable to wear for hours without any strain or pressure on the ears- guess this is the silver lining. But forget trying to run or exercise in these. The lack of wingtips is probably the biggest issue with the design to ensure a secure fit.The only other thing I liked about these buds besides their ""loose-fitting"" wearing comfort is the ANC- it did a very good job drowning out the sound of rushing water and other background noises. So they get 1 star for comfort and one star for ANC.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AGR3ZAJTIBAZ7LNI4EWCCAYH6UMA,1,9,Color: Charcoal,"February 17, 2023",2023-02-17,2023-02,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

R3IM3XJG07YXEJ,B0B1NGPY94,4.0 out of 5 stars Honestly impressed despite all the hate. Read so I can explain.,Gabriel,4.0,"I have been a follower of the Google Pixel Buds since their initial release, and have had all of them besides the Pixel A-Series that are basically the Godfather Part 3 of this tech trilogy.For this review I am basing my rating on the upgrade from the Pixel Buds (2nd Gen 2020) and other earbuds of a similar price point.Let's get started!First and foremost I will comment on the quality of sound, afterall thats why many choose to purchase earbuds yes?Yes, I do agree with the other reviews, for $200.00 (or $150.00 if purchased on sale) you can get much better sounding earbuds for the price, even half the price! So why would I give it 4/5 starts? Simple, because these are not designed to be your in-ear beat box party, these are marketed as productivity earbuds. So I am not comparing these earbuds to top tier Skullcandys or Beats, I am comparing these to other productivity earbuds such as the Samsung Galaxy Buds, Surface Buds, and Amazon Echo Buds. The sound quality giving its productivity design is a HUGE jump from the 2nd gen 2020 design which I already thought was a big improvement from the other options available. The bass in this design sounds remarkable. The noise cancelation is very tippy, I work in a loud warehouse where ventilation and equipment make very loud noises. When I popped them in I heard them activate and it was like it has a mini vacuum to create a seal inside my ears. But I was still able to hear close by sounds for my own safety. Very nice sound with music with clarity on individual sounds intended by the artists.Now I want to spend some time on the comfort of the design. There are allot of complaints on the getting rid of the rubber peice from precious models of the Pixel buds and now having a fat design that looks like a half full blood tick. I was very skeptical and with one bud in my ear, it felt like it was going to fall out! But it never has!! It's in there, I have looked at its design and I think it's the airflow design for its bass that makes it feel like there is air that doesn't create a full seal into your ear canals, but it's in there, and I have put it to the test, never has it fallen out my ears.Yes they are fat. But I've had them in my ears all day and never gotten fatigued. My Gen 2 Buds made my ears sore after just 1 hour, so big improvement.The gestures are about the same as the Gen 2, if it isn't broken why fix it?I haven't played with the software upgrades yet from this new model so I will be updating this review soon.Until then I give these Buds 4/5. It's the best in its competition, but I think there are improvements in the sound quality that can be reasonably made to make it stand out just a hair more.","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2022",AH7R273IHABA2HUDYPNJXSFP4NKQ,1,41,Color: Charcoal,"November 1, 2022",2022-11-01,2022-11,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

But the big difference for me is that wearing the PIxel Buds Pro causes my ear canals to sweat and itch. I have no clue what causes this to happen, and this is not a problem I have had with either the normal (non-noise canceling) Google Pixel Buds or noise-canceling Samsung Galaxy earbuds. Or any other earbud or headphones I have ever used for that matter, as far as I can remember.Google Pixel Buds Pro are also a bit bulky, I have small ears and I always use the smallest size of earbud tips, and I would say Samsung fits better and they stay in even when exerting myself during workouts. But I find myself cinching the Google Pixel Buds Pro into my ear canal periodically, even when sitting and not doing anything physically that would dislodge them.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AGWAIHF5L463OR7RKQDIEZXCEYNQ,1,1,Color: Fog,"July 8, 2024",2024-07-08,2024-07,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro
R29Y55IVTGHIW8,B0B1NGPY94,4.0 out of 5 stars Fit: 3/5 controls: 5/5,Brenda,4.0,"I have had lots of earbud. I mostly listen to audiobooks or podcasts at work, but when watching videos at home, the sounds quality is superb. Many buds don't stay in well or have caused excessive tugging on the canal. By the end of the day, my canal can feel raw. There are loosely fitted buds I've used with good results, but they bleed audio badly. I had the last iteration of pixel buds and they didn't stay in well for me. These stay in BETTER, but if your ear canal is damp, you could experience slippage. Particularly when moving your jaw. Since I have a lots of memory foam tips for various earbuds, I have been able to solve the issue, even during workouts. These are light and rest enough on the cartilage of the ear to not cause pain at the end of the day. As many have said, battery life is also more then sufficient. If you're wearing these at work, you'll be fine. Alternating buds or turning off noise cancellation when not needed will milk the battery for a full shift without putting them in the case. The reason I couldn't wait to get back to pixel buds after trying 7+ other brands, is the controls. Nobody does touch controls like pixel buds yet. I find I have to cup the entire earbuds with others to pause because the controls are so finicky. Beyond that, I can wear one earbud while working and have full control of volume with a swipe left or right. I can choose to use Google assistant for the long tap, control noise cancellation, or use ""hey Google"". Making calls on the job or managing audio when a client needs assistance is smooth. There is a learning curve. These have controls closer to the cartilage of your ear rather than centered over the canal, where you'd normally reach for controls, but compared to others its still ahead of the game. I'm overall happy. The fit could use improvement, but I feel memory foam tips will solve this for most.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",AELHSLXO3UVHQKP23JF4TUK6TAKA,1,4,Color: Lemongrass,"October 31, 2023",2023-10-31,2023-10,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

R3RBQ1N187VAQV,B0B1NGPY94,4.0 out of 5 stars Replacing 2nd gen Pixel Buds,Paul Suquet,4.0,"I'll start by saying I'm an audio engineer, and I have an addiction to headphones and earphones. I have a set for recording vocals, a set for recording instruments, IEMs for recording drums, IEMs for mixing on the go, over the ear for mixing in my home studio, another set of in-ears and another set of over-ear for pleasure listening at home and yet another set for travel. I must have well over 50 sets of earphones & earbuds between my home and studio. There's simply no set that can do it all for me (yet). And that's a problem, because then I'm always looking.Now, these earphones are not designed to be used as IEMs or for critical listening, but still, I must say, for the past few years, the earphones I've used the most, were the 2nd gen Pixel Buds. The integration with the assistant was superb, battery was acceptable (for me) and sound quality was above average. Sure, they will never beat the ATH-M50x but why would they? Still, the sum of their parts, was enough for them to be the ones I reached out to use the most (outside a studio environment).Ordered these Pixel Buds Pro as soon as I could, and was disappointed in the sound quality. I found them to be less clear, more muddy. By the time I tested them, the EQ in the phone's settings was not yet available so I couldn't tune them at all (except for the ""bass boost"" that was offered as an ""enhancement"" through the app). But their transparency mode, which I've always enjoyed in earphones and headphones I've owned over the years that featured it, was simply the best I've ever heard. It's amazing and sometimes I need to go to the app just to verify if it's on because I'm tricked into thinking there's something up. It's perfectly transparent. The Assistant integration is as good as ever. Battery life is much improved and the buds themselves seem to fit better in my ears. On top of this, the multilink is perfect, as I believe most of us will switch between our computers and our phones on the daily, these do it seamlessly.So everything was great, except for sound quality. Fortunately, I use PowerAmp for my music listening, so I could use the built in EQ. Eventually, the ANC, Transparency mode, Assistant and comfort meant I was reaching out for these instead of the old version more often than not.A few months in, the custom EQ for the earbuds is now available through the pixel buds app, and while these still don't compare to most of my other earphones/headphones, they are now my most used because once again; the sum of its parts.I'm giving them 4 stars overall, which I feel is well deserved. 5 stars on every aspect, and 4 stars on sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2022",AHS6A5AKPSGIVHXIKYTY6NKPWRJQ,1,40,Color: Fog,"November 9, 2022",2022-11-09,2022-11,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

When turned on it definitely cuts back on the background noise but it leaves behind what I would describe as an artificial (or ""tinny"") quality that doesn't leave the resulting experience seeming as if the background noise was simply removed. When using them with the noise cancellation in the wind I also get a decent amount of sound getting passed through via the noise-cancellation microphones, but turning that feature off will fix that at the cost of making the background sounds a little louder.Each earbud will report the current battery level, which is nice. There is also a clever workaround to the case not having it's own Bluetooth radio for that same purpose - when the case is open and an earbud is still seated inside the battery level of the case will be reported through the headphone connection. It's not the fastest pairing bluetooth earbud set that I've used so you may need to leave a single earbud in the case for an extra five seconds to get the information you need, but overall it's nice to have.My biggest complaint is way they stay in your ears. I don't have a problem with the fit normally - I use the medium size of the included silicone tips and get a very secure fit (which is verified using the ""test fit"" function in the pixel buds app that will measure the pressures inside). My only complaint is that there is only the silicone tip and no little wing or ear wrap to help hold it in like the Pixel Buds A-Series. Mine will come loose if I frequently move my head up and down over 5 minutes (reading a book on and off) or if I move my jaw (listening to music while eating lunch). They're easy to get back into place, but then they slide very slightly out shortly afterwards.I recommend the Pixel Buds Pro, but not at their full price. If you can find them for <$200 that would give you a much better value. I have a refurbished (Amazon Renewed) pair that I got for $125 and I am extremely happy with what I got for my money.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2023",AFB3WYM2FGBAKKVDWVABXCE5QMTQ,1,19,Color: Fog,"April 28, 2023",2023-04-28,2023-04,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

I must say I was surprised by the good quality of the noise canceling filter, it's very comfortable even if you don't want to hear any song it's still a very useful tool just to hear the silent.Also the sound quality is very good, but this is something less important to know as almost every headphones today have a good quality in the sound. The differences is usually in the microphone, the cheap brands can't provide enough quality for the microphone to filter all the noise from outside, therfore their headphones less useful for calls.I gave it only 4 stars because I expect Google to sell at more affordable price, as they are still not famous in headphones like other brands.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AHSG64RPP5CXV3273LSHEWXGREPA,1,0,Color: Charcoal,"March 1, 2024",2024-03-01,2024-03,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

R2E7FXY6NSB26E,B0B1NGPY94,5.0 out of 5 stars Rivals the Apple AirPods Pro 3,Oneil,5.0,"I've had my Google Pixel Buds Pro for over 6 months now and I absolutely love them! I had the Apple AirPods Pro (3rd Gen) previously and remember being on a windy beach and talking to my friend on the phone without missing a beat. When I finally got in my car after chatting with her for about an hour, I asked her if she had heard any of the wind or noise while I was on the beach. She responded incredulously, ""You were on the beach?"" And that's when I realized how absolutely amazing Apple's noise canceling functionality was on their airpods. I did a similar test when I received my Pixel Buds Pro. I remember my friend mentioning the sound of gravel as I walked on the pathway by a local park. With my new Pixel Buds Pro all she heard was my voice when I did the same walk, while I was driving with windows down and vehicles honking on the road, as well as in any other number of loud and boisterous environments. The Pixel Bud Pros perform as well as the AirPods and fit snugly in my ear, rarely every falling out. The only complaint I have about them is that the battery doesn't last much longer than about 2-3 hours when on the phone. The case will charge them up wirelessly but I'd love for them to last a good 6-7 hours without requiring a charge.Outside of that, I am EXTREMELY happy with my purchase and glad I got them at a cheaper price point than the AirPod Pros. I bought them for $149 and so they were $100 cheaper than the AirPods. Best of all, they sync beautifully with my Google Pixel phone, whereas the AirPod Pros were problematic. I had to download a third party app to check the battery life and get them to connect to my phone. This was way more hassle than I wanted to deal with.I would highly recommend the Pixel Bud Pros to anyone with an Android device. I certainly don't go anywhere with them!","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2023",AFDSD6GT4EDS4EKHOQKRWUTRTPCA,1,5,Color: Charcoal,"November 26, 2023",2023-11-26,2023-11,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

This means I have my windows down and the engine is loud enough I can't use the speakers on my car because I can't hear it. I put these in, turn on noise cancelling by lightly holding the face of the earbud for 2 sec and I can no longer hear my car, however the more important noises from driving (honking, sirens, etc, still filter into the earbud through the mic.

R1Z7EANJVXNNIJ,B0B1NGPY94,5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasantly surprised,Sapphire M,5.0,"Let's jump to the key points:-The noise cancellation on these is SCARY good. Even without music playing, it's hard to hear people talking to you when both are in.-The transparency mode is great. Still gives you solid sound quality but it's not putting you in a sound proof box.-Battery life isn't anything special in comparison to any other set of headphones I've ever owned. They last most of the work day (8 hours) though, so it's not as if it's terrible. If you listen to the volume super low, you'll get another hour or two out of them.-These are super customizable. You can boost bass and all that jazz. Sound quality I'd give a 4/5. They're not THE BEST but they are way above other brands.-The google assistant is nice. It makes a soft beep when a notification pops up, and will read the texts to you. In general, all notifications are a soft sound. When the battery is dying it gives soft little bloops, even if the volume had been up high.-I love the fact it gives you individual battery levels. Each ear bud will have it's own battery percentage on your phone so if you start out with one and pick up the other, you'll know where you're at with each PRIOR to them dying.-Another feature I love love love.... if you take an earbud out, it'll pause your music for you. This extends to movies as well. So if you get interrupted, you won't miss out on anything. Once you put it back in it'll resume playing automatically.-Comfortable fit. It comes with multiple ear tips, but the ones that came on them fit well. No matter what, my ears have always gotten an uncomfortable feeling after wearing them for awhile, but I can go the entire day with these in and it doesn't hurt. Sometimes I actually forget I have them in. They're also movement proof. I've yet to have one fall out of my ear, or even shift while bending, lifting, anything.TDLR; battery life is pretty good, but not magnificent. These are beyond comfortable. The noise cancellation will make you feel like you're in a silence booth.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2023",AG4UMK4QU6QEYSK53ZD46RK3WZDQ,1,18,Color: Fog,"December 10, 2023",2023-12-10,2023-12,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

The Tozos never caused discomfort in my ears. The controls are pretty customizable, but I find the tap to pause does not always work.

However, the only thing I missed on it was volume control. When I lost one, I upgraded to the pro because I really missed volume control and now they won't stay in my ears.

R36HMW6YNYY84N,B0B1NGPY94,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound, amazing noise canceling, amazing battery life",BR,5.0,"18 months ago I purchased the Pixel Buds A-Series, and I've loved them! In almost every way, they are great wireless earbuds. But now that that my work-from-home status is permanent, and business travel is once again a thing, my requirements have changed. The lack of multipoint Bluetooth has become a hassle, with the need to do calls on both a phone and the computer. Air travel is once again a thing, and I'd love to be able to dispense with the hardcase for over the ear noise cancelling headphones. So, I decided to upgrade to the Pixel Buds Pro.Good choice!The Pixel Buds Pro pick up where the A-Series left off, and run with it. Sound quality is amazing, as it was on the A-Series, but by eliminating the vented in-ear structure the music is clearer. Multipoint allows the buds to be connected to my phone and my computer simultaneously, which eliminates the need to start tapping to disconnect from one device and connect to the other when a call comes in. And the ANC is fantastic. When I have the buds in my ears, with ANC turned on (which is most of the time) I forget about all of the sounds going on around me. It's a real shock to take them out and realize that the micrwave oven is running 5 feet from me, or that the heat is on, or the dishwasher is running. It works that well. But with a tap I can turn on passthrough mode, and carry on a conversation with someone in the room. Very slick.I'm headed cross country in a couple weeks, and it will be nice to be able to put the buds in when i board the plane, and have the ANC active all the way to the west coast without recharging.So, the downsides? The only one that I've found so far is that these are slippery little things. They definitely take some practice before you can extract them from their charging case. But I had the same issue with the A-Series buds, and after a few days I got proficient at plucking them from their case. I'm sure the same will be true here. And that is literally the only negative that I can list.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the Pixel Buds Pro. They aren't cheap, but they were a great purchase!","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2023",AHOR2TWQMZTQFZAZAQQJB77UOJOQ,1,12,Color: Lemongrass,"March 15, 2023",2023-03-15,2023-03,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro
R2E2BUW1O6JBX6,B0B1NGPY94,3.0 out of 5 stars Constantly falling out of ear and out of case,Kenneth Welling,3.0,"These headphones have many nice features but these features were nullified by some fundamental problems. Right out of the box, one of the headphones would crackle loudly as I was pushing them into my ears. This was painful and distressing at such a high price point, but I could get past that.The main problem was that I was constantly losing them because they fall out of my ears and out of the case. I tried all of the ear adapter sizes, but was unsuccessful at getting them to sit snuggly in my ear. I used them at the climbing gym and they would fall out in the middle of a tricky climb, so I would have to descend quickly and try to find them on the floor before somebody stepped on them.Also, because they stick so far out of my ear, the climbing rope would constantly brush them and make my music stop- which again is really irritating in the middle of difficult climb.The worst problem is that if you drop the case any distance at all, the lid will pop open and send the earbuds flying. It happened right away when I bought them. They bounce around pretty far, so I eventually found them inside one of my shoes. This happened again several times. The last time was when I was climbing outside, and I lost both earbuds. One of them flew into my friends lap as he was laying downhill on a hammock. The other I couldn't find. I put the one I did find in my case AND DROPPED IT AGAIN while searching for the first one. As normal, the lid popped open and sent the remaining bud flying too. I was unable to find it amongst the leaves, so now I am out a 200+ dollar set of earbuds.If you buy these, make sure you buy the brightest pair you can find because you are going to be looking for them a lot. They do have a feature to play noise through them if you lose them, and you are going to be needing it a lot. This didn't help me in the end because the battery had died and I couldn't connect to them.","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023",AGZJOKWEKNF7YZNVHEAUFU766IXA,1,11,Color: Charcoal,"October 28, 2023",2023-10-28,2023-10,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

Everything makes my ears fatigue within minutes.These on the other hand, do not (at least right away). My ears are very sensitive so in-ear doesn't traditionally work for me. I can wear these for 1.5-2hrs before I get even a remote feeling of fatigue. It's no where near as bad as it was with the others (which physically hurt to take out).I really like the ANC and volume on these. They're not too loud and not too low with the volume so I don't fear of harming my hearing. They're definitely slightly lower than others in that regard but I don't see that as a negative.I've found the medium tips work best for my ears. They literally create a nice suction in my ear and keep them in. I thought it was weird at first but honestly can see the value in it considering they have never fallen out. I grocery shop with these on, drive, mow my lawn, walk around the house, and work with these buds. They're great.The multi-point feature is great too. I use it with my Pixel 7 Pro and have it also connected to my work windows laptop for popping in for meetings. Within a fairly steady 4 seconds, it'll automatically kick over the input without me having to pair or unpair these. I would like to see this accept 3 active connections for multi-point in the future but it's still new so I understand that it doesn't.The spatial audio is wonderful--I just wish more things supported it. From using Spotify on a daily basis, I can confidently say I'm overly impressed with these buds. I have yet to use them when travelling but I'm actively looking forward to it since most plane rides were cumbersome with other brands.I have to say, the physical build quality of the case and the buds themselves blow Apple out of the water. The satisfying snap of the case is so wonderful. My only gripe with physical quality is the lack of a charge cable. I understand not including a charging block as most devices do, but for this price they should at least include a 3 inch USB-C charge cable.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023",AF4WXQ76V5AKCYMMDJJTGNGT6YYA,1,21,Color: Charcoal,"August 18, 2023",2023-08-18,2023-08,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

They also come with a Find My Device feature, enabling you to locate your misplaced earbuds.Overall, the Google Pixel Buds Pro are a solid choice for those seeking high-quality wireless earbuds with noise-canceling capabilities.

R33OCKGNXSBLPN,B0B1NGPY94,"4.0 out of 5 stars ANC isn't as good as Jabra 75t, but everything else is an upgrade",Dan Hoang,4.0,"Been using the Jabra Elite 75t for some time now for my home/office work flow, but realized the hassle of having to reconnect the buds to other devices beyond my work laptop and phone wasn't worth the effort and now that I have a Pixel 7 Pro and the Pixel Buds Pro were on sale, decided to give them a shot.Pros:- transparency mode is great! Can hear things clearly and without the digital artifacts that my 75ts exhibit while using Hearthrough. Sounds seem mostly natural and somewhat amplified (see con below), however.- don't even feel them in my ear using stock silicon medium sized ear tips (current testing foam tips to see if ANC performance increases)- appreciate the visual design of the buds themselves- tight integration with Pixel 7- spacial audio with head tracking is a cool, albeit limited, feature. Was watching The Mandalorian season 3 and noticed that if I turned my head, the sound would favor the direction that my phone was facing me from, as well has any height audio that may come through. Watching Terminal List on Amazon yielded no such benefit.- can use one at a time and doesn't matter which oneCons- Pixel Buds app seems to drain phone battery quicker while buds are active --- still trying to figure out why this is the case- case is bigger than elite 75t and orientation seems less intuitive when trying to put them back in after use (obviously matters less as you get used to them)- ANC seems to favor blocking out lows and mids but highs still come through. I feel like this is a tuning issue. Both transparency and ANC modes favor higher pitched sounds and even swapping out ear tips (med to lrg and silicone to foam) have no apparent effect. The Jabra ANC could be adjusted and I wish there was a similar feature for the buds.I will keep these buds, as the value is there (not full MSRP) and being able to use 1 at a time is a boon","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AGLCGF6YTQJMZN2VOADGZXENW6HQ,1,2,Color: Lemongrass,"March 24, 2023",2023-03-24,2023-03,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro
R17UOTIEMKM6T2,B0B1NGPY94,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great in most waus, but might fall out",Stephen Morrison Lewis,4.0,"There's a lot of good to say about the Pixel Buds Pro. They're small, feature rich, sound great and work well with the Android ecosystem. The noise canceling isn't quite top-tier, but is solid. The main problem is the fit. While comfortable, it is difficult to get them to pass the fit test. I usually take medium eartips, but the fit test wouldn't pass me even on large tips. I bought Spinfit eartips because they usually get a better fot, and they still failed. It didn't bother me at first, because they still sound great, but I soon figured out it's hard to seat them properly. Specifically, it's easy to pop them in but get a fit that will loosen easily. You can get a secure fit, but you really have to fiddle with them, and probably activate whatever you have assigned to the long-press of the touch panels in the process.I have also noticed that the sound is lower than most earbuds I've owned. Maybe this is because I can't get a proper seal, but most buds sound plenty loud at about 40% for me, and these need to be 50% or so to get tue same effect. This isn't so bad for me personally, but anyone who's cranking other earbuds may find these too quiet.One element I do wish to praise is the battery life. These promise 7 hours with ANC on, and most earbuds under-deliver in the real world because those are optimal conditions. Even with the volume higher than normal, these buds look to deliver at least 7.5 hours, and maybe a full 8. I never fully drained them so I cannot be certain.I really want to like these buds, which may skew my rating a little more positive than it could be. The fact is, these would likely be my daily drivers if not for the fit issues. I do wish they had a few more features, like fully custom conteols or HD codecs, but I would still use these daily if I wasn't so worried I'd lose them.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2023",AHVLVHAXRE3GVBYFQIXLOFC25DUA,1,28,Color: Fog,"June 28, 2023",2023-06-28,2023-06,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

I've owned at least one version of every Pixel gadget - phones, watch, tablet, and these buds, but I've got to say these buds have soured me on the whole ecosystem. Yeah, they pair easily (big whoop, so do a lot of brands now). Here's what I don't like:1. The touch controls on the buds are nice in theory, but annoying in practice. Every time you try to make any kind of adjustment in your ear, you end up triggering some random thing with the touch controls like turning on or off the noise cancellation or bumping up to the next track or adjusting the volume when all you were trying to do was twist the little thing in your ear for a better fit.2. They didn't stay put. I'm not using these for workouts, just casual listening and sleeping, and they hardly ever stay in place. You can ""yawn"" them out of place. You can ""chew"" them out of place. Then you have to adjust them and guess what happens? (See point #1)3. Finally, the ANC is buggy. My left earbud constantly ""chirps"" at me, like the mic and driver make little feedback noises that only stop when I disable ANC. What's the point of paying $150 for a pair of buds and not being able to use the ANC?I'm sad, because I wanted to love these, but after more than a year of patient use, I am ready to admit I hate them, and I feel duped for buying them just because they are part of the Pixel universe.I'm going back to my Sound Core Space A40 buds. They are only about 1/3 the price, have better battery life, no annoying touch controls, and stay put without chirping.(And yes, I tried all the different tip sizes, mixed and matched sizes, even bought off brand memory foam replacement tips, and made sure to keep the firmware up to date on the buds. Nothing worked.)","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGGDLFBD4CV4K3OUA7ED7ZTCMRFQ,1,0,Color: Lemongrass,"August 1, 2024",2024-08-01,2024-08,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

Changing the volume when you tap to pause is the most common issue I have, but they skip songs when I try to pause, too. The most egregious part though is the shape of the earbuds. They're more rectangular than any headphones or earbuds I've ever had, and they don't stay in my ears on their own at all. They fall out constantly, which has led to water damage and damage from falling to the ground constantly. I've heard that a LOT of people have this problem, no matter what you change the tip size to.The battery is pretty good, but the case battery is very disappointing; I have to charge it at least once a day or once every other day which can be frustrating, though not a dealbreaker","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AHIQJM5XHGTF45TXDVZVQQWTYSNQ,1,1,Color: Charcoal,"January 19, 2024",2024-01-19,2024-01,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

I was reliant on Bose Sleepbuds but as they have been discontinued, I needed an in-ear bud that would work for 8+ hours. Once I got used to the fit, these worked well and do last for hours if fully charged. However, there is NO option to turn off the low battery alarm, so when it gets to 15-20% you will always get a bunch of chimes in your ear. Defeats the purpose of using these for sleep (unless you sleep 6 or fewer hours).

Well they are and then some. I'm a fan of Google's Pixel series and I love the design of the earbuds (my phone is also the lemon grass color) I love the color coordination. But let's be honest, if the earbuds are only okay who cares what color they are right? Now I also really liked my Raycons (RIP) but I wasn't a fan of the new design, plus from what I saw they didn't have much of a change in quality from the 24 series. So I decided to jump on the Prime Day sale and get Google's earbuds. The sound quality is great, it is truly noise cancelling you will not hear anyone without pausing your music. That could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the situation. I will admit that at first I was having some issues when it came to changing/ skipping songs. They seemed to not work and I thought I just had defective buds and was going to send them back. But it turned out to be user error, what a surprise... I do have to admit, if I could ask for one thing in the design it would be to have the button on the buds be a functioning one, then I don't have to guess if i hit it twice or not even with the little sound indicator going off. The charge holds so long that I think it makes up for it. I would definitely recommend especially if you're in the market for new buds and are on the fence about which one to go for.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2023",AGCHVCH7TCUILIBOMHIMPRZA4UFA,1,10,Color: Lemongrass,"August 10, 2023",2023-08-10,2023-08,Google,Google Pixel Buds Pro

It's really good and I only have two problems with it. I don't notice it much expect on a windy day but when transparency mode is on or noise cancelling sort of you can hear like gushes of wind. It's a lot more noticable in transparency mode than noise cancelling but it's something interesting I noticed. Another problem is price, my title says Great 'sales' price because I think the sales price should be the price of the earbuds instead of $200 (also why I rated it a 4/5).

The best part though was the buds' ear wings...these buds stayed in my ears!Cut to the present and I just got a Pixel 7 Pro and wanted to try Google's new buds so I tried both the Pros and the A-series. The A-series still has the ear wings but unfortunately no ANC and the sound is still just ok. However!.....these new Pro Buds are a wonderful advancement for Google. I was skeptical but let me give some detail:1) They're very comfortable but they were falling out until I bought third-party tips that actually provide a better fit!2) Music sound quality is terrific! Rich with just enough bass. Not as much separation as the Airpods Pro but still very good.3) Noise-cancelling is amazing! This one floored me cause I was expecting a subpar experience.4) Call quality could be better. I've had people tell me they couldn't hear me.5) A couple times when I've left them in my ears with the music off some buzzing sound came on. I had to unpair and pair again and it went away. Don't know what that's from. I'm gonna try another pair and see if its still present.6) Lastly, the case is the most comfortable to carry, even more than the Airpods Pro.

I was a little skeptical about their size, but the design seems to be done in such a way that they sit in the ear correctly.The battery life seems to be much longer than the Apple Pros 2 and can assume that the size of the pod provides more room a larger battery. This is ideal for people who use their pods all day long or for long distant travel with minimal access or time for charge.Sound quality is very similar (if not better than) the Apple Pros 2. I get a full balance of highs and lows. I typically listen to electronic and rock music. Both genres seem to work wonderfully with these headphones. For those who like a good amount of bass in their music, these should not upset.The noise canceling is the only feature that did not work as well as it does in the Apple Airpod Pros as it did not dampen the sound as well. This is not a deal breaker for me but it could be for others.

The primary reason for purchasing these was to use them for WORK (WFH, need to be able to hear clients, have them hear me with no background noise, take meetings etc) with the secondary reason being casual listening at home while I‚Äôm scrolling my phone, cleaning, etc etc etc. So if you‚Äôre wanting to know whether or not these are Gods gift to audio, you‚Äôre on the wrong review!Fit: I‚Äôm starting here because it seems to be what everyone complained the most about in the reviews. HOWEVER, I think the fit is absolutely perfect, incredible - all the positive descriptive words. Each bud is as LIGHT as a feather. I needed to be able to make sure I could wear these for extended periods of time without experiencing discomfort‚Ä¶ and I have! Since I received them I hardly take them off. I have tried sleeping in them and while discomfort wasn‚Äôt the issue, the touch controls were triggered by my pillow so it wasn‚Äôt functional for nighttime listening (sleep stories are a game changer). Otherwise, I work in them, I clean in them, I play games in them‚Ä¶ everything. They stay in, they feel secure though most of the time I forget they‚Äôre even there. More than anything I‚Äôm so freaking glad they don‚Äôt go IN my ear canal. I have always avoided headphones because I hate the ear canal ones (gross) and the big bulky ones just are not it.App: The app you can control these with is perfect, and I‚Äôll be including some screenshots in my review. First of all, HAVING an app I can use to manage them is amazing. I like that it‚Äôs easy to figure out and doesn‚Äôt throw an overwhelming amount of options or customizations at you. You can;- Monitor battery life for each individual bud AND the charging case (freaking love);- Adjust the audio to your liking (full EQ customization + preset options like vocal or bass boost);- Set up multipoint pairing. SO happy with this function, I can‚Äôt even explain. It took some figuring out though‚Ä¶more later;- And customize controls. This was probably my favorite feature, as I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the default options and I was able to change the controls to what works for ME!*My ONLY critique, and I cannot explain how insignificant this is in the grand scheme, is that I wish in the control customization that I had the option to switch which ear was volume up and which was volume down. IDK how to explain it other than my brain doesn‚Äôt process volume down being on the left side. Maybe throw it in the suggestion box for the next model, which I will definitely be buying regardless.Battery: It‚Äôs great. I put these puppies to use, for all the reasons mentioned above. They get me through my workday and an evening of listening to music before needing to charge. I say needing to charge, but even then they‚Äôre still around 20-25%. It feels like I get endless charges out of the case, and they charge quick.Audio: Again, not an audiophile. With that being said, I think they sound great. The EQ customization is awesome, I prefer to just go with one of the preset options. On that note, I‚Äôm glad they have the preset options and I think they‚Äôre great. I have been listening to my music on treble boost with no complaints. Love being able to quickly switch to the vocal option for work. Bass boost at the highest of volumes sounds a little tinny but otherwise they sound like normal headphones.Mic: So far, no complaints. I was very worried about my clients and colleagues being able to pick up on background noise because of my dogs, but I‚Äôve asked several people on the other end if they could hear anything other than me and they all said no. Everyone has said they can only hear me, and I sound normal + clear.Multi-point pairing: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. This was actually a welcome surprise, I didn‚Äôt realize they had the feature until I received them. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve captured the full potential here yet or not, but this is a really handy feature for how I personally use them. Being that I need to be able to pair them to both my personal phone and my work laptop, this makes it so seamless. I can easily connect or disconnect to one, the other, or both at the same time if I want. This allows me to toggle back and forth between work and personal activities so easily.

I've tried all manner of ear buds, from super cheap to really expensive, and these are the first set of ear buds that I can wear all day without any pain whatsoever. It took a little getting used to the way that they fit because they did sort of feel like they were on the verge of falling out when I first got them, but this is just due to a different design than I've ever experienced and they're actually quite secure and not going anywhere. I do find myself forgetting that I have them on and will walk around with nothing playing, wearing them for hours sometimes. Even as a glasses wearer, I don't find myself having any problems with comfort or secure fit.The sound quality is honestly the best I've experienced in all of the ear buds I've tried.

I've used them for listening to music, watching YouTube, watching TV shows and movies, and have never felt that I needed to adjust the EQ. They really just sound great for all uses, in my opinion.I love the way that you put them into pairing mode - I did have to look up a YouTube video on how to do it because I struggled to understand the instructions provided, but it's actually really easy and reliable, and one of the easier pairing experiences I've had. I have a few pairs of headphones/ear buds that are a major pain to pair and fall out of being paired randomly, and I've had none of those issues with these.I haven't had any issues with the touch controls not working right, though I don't use these for running and it seems the majority of reviewers having issues with the touch controls are runners who experience sweat, so that could be why I've had no issues. I'm a stay at home mom who works part time from home and home schools my kid, so my typical use of these is while sitting at a computer working, or while walking around my home doing school or chores.They're not super noise canceling and they don't have the longest battery life but that is exactly as advertised. Being open ear fit they couldn't possibly be noise canceling (though they do actually drown out most sound pretty well if the volume is up high), which is actually what I need in ear buds as a stay at home mom who needs to be able to hear my kid at all times. I don't want to give these a low review on noise cancellation or battery life because they're clearly advertised as not being noise canceling, and also clearly advertised that the ear buds themselves only have a 7 hour battery life and the case has a 28 hour battery life, so it would seem unfair to lower their rating over something that you're advertised before even buying. Maybe in future models they'll be able to increase the battery life, but until then it is totally fine with me as someone who is home pretty much at all times and able to recharge without issue.I am super happy with these, and so pleased to have finally found ear buds I can wear without pain. After years of searching, I finally found a pair that works for me and actually sounds great, too.","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2024",AFJSGZFTTESCRCIT73FOOZI2L6RQ,1,95,Color: Beige,"April 25, 2024",2024-04-25,2024-04,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

R7HLWLMR7DB0Y,B0BYSQDWRT,4.0 out of 5 stars Really good but two issues that keep them from being excellent...,Amazon Customer,4.0,"I'm a Bluetooth earbuds geek, having owned the to of the line Boss, Apple, Sennheiser, Jabra, Pixel, Samsong, etc. over the past 5 years. I also own the Shokz (Aftershokz) OpenComm bone conduction headset. When I saw these Shokz OpenFit earbuds with the ear hooks, I i had to give them a try. They are really nice. The sound is excellent and adequately loud for my taste. The OpenComm bone conduction was not loud enough in a crowd, but since these place the speakers directly over the ear canal, the volume is much better. I like that they don't block out your surroundings and it provides natural sound of your surroundings, not the ""ambient"" (artificial) sound from other earbuds with accompanying white noise. The noise cancelling mic is quite good. Voice on the other end is good. It blocks out more than 95 percent of the noise without sounding artificial it mechanical. Battery life is on par or better than most of the competition (7 hrs). The app allows some customization and is simple enough so as not to be confusing. I only have two complaints (one minor and one major): Minor complaint: The East hooks are comfortable but I found that the earbud itself pressed on the antihelical fold where, after several hours, it became painful to the touch... Perhaps this will be something that you can get used to, but it is worth mention. 2) The touch controls are lacking. Other high end earbuds offer 3 or 4 sets of controls: single tap L/R, double tap L/R, double tap L/R, touch and hold L/R, and done also offer d surface swipe. That, those though too many choice may be confusing, give you enough options to control everything. The OpenFit only offer double tap and tap and hold; and they only offer a select limited set of combinations. For instance, if you set double tap L: answer/end, play/pause and double tap R: voice assistant, then you can choose tap and hold L/R to next previous or volume +/-, but not both. That's a major problem. What's lacking is single tap. That would give you the options needed to control calls and music without having to reach for the phone. I don't want to have to pick up my phone or take it out of my pocket to do all the things other earbuds can do. For the price, these earbuds should offer more touch controls than they offer.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AETG66Z5GM4L5ELN5GGRLMDDBOBA,1,12,Color: Black,"July 21, 2024",2024-07-21,2024-07,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones
RF3K6KF5J8IZL,B0BYSQDWRT,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality for a headphone that doesn't go right in the ear,Alex,5.0,"Ive been a big fan of Shokz because I hate earphones that go in my ear as they never seen to get a good fit and always make my ear sore. I've been using the Shokz bone conduction hp's at the gym for years but the battery is not lasting long anymore so I figured it was time to update. I decided to try the Open Fits even though they aren't bone conduction due to how small they were and the added battery life the case gave. Right off the bat the sound was much better. More full sound with bass over the BC Shokz. They sit pretty comfortable in my ear and at times its easy to forget they are there. Pairing was pretty simple as they went into pairing mode when I opened the case. I don't believe you are able to pair these when they are outside the case so make sure not to unpair if you don't have the case in hand.I also use a pair of Open Run Shokz for my computer headphones and was looking to see if these Open Fit could replace those. Oddly enough, the open airs were not as loud and clear with voice as the Open Runs. Music sounded better but voice was lower and not as clear. This isnt as shocking as bone conduction seems to transmit voice much better and clearer. I didnt deduct a star because I mainly will use my new Open Airs for the gym and I wasn't looking to replace my Open Runs just yet but if you were looking to use these mainly for voice you might need to look elsewhere.Over all I'm happy with the new purchase and I will be putting my BC Shokz in my car as a backup pair just in case.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AGH7XXLV2R4RM6VVTJ4FAUDO3BTA,1,2,Color: Black,"July 17, 2024",2024-07-17,2024-07,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones
R30H0ZFGWF1DOU,B0BYSQDWRT,5.0 out of 5 stars Love them! Although it has limitations,James Dannug,5.0,"Bought them because i wanted something light and comfortable with an open ear experience. I've tried the Shokz OpenRun and while they're fine to maintain the openear experience, i realized I didn't love the band behind my hear when laying on a bench working out and didn't like the pads wresting on the skin just in front of my ear, felt sweaty.Then OpenFits are amazing. I can wear them ands till here things without that tunnel, I can listen to the music as if I was listening to music from external radio speakers but keeping it to myself. Sound quality is fine. Its great for what it is but you can't compare them to a full over the ear quality headphone, theres just no comparison there, but for what their purpose is I'm extremely happy. I also like on the app has preset audio settings and I like to use the Voal settings for audiobooks so I can here a crisper sharper voice I can pickup amongst ambient noise better. But then when listening to music I can turn on bass boost or stereo for a fuller satisfying listening experience.The one thing that I'm surprised about is the battery life doesn't last forever. Because they're so comfortable and I don't realize I'm still earing them, I probably wear them longer than i would other earbuds or headphones and that makes me use it more, and listen to my audiobooks for longer periods than I would with other headphones. So the battery goes quicker than I'm used to but its a quick charge back in the case. The other thing is, is that I'm surprised when I see the case battery level, always seems lower than I'd expect. but that expectation is without any real baseline or context for where it should be.All in all I'm extremely happy i have them and they're my main pair in my bag all the time!","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AFDQ2FWRGOW5KLV3KTWF6CFQ2ELQ,1,1,Color: Black,"July 16, 2024",2024-07-16,2024-07,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones
R12Q8SRZQASN3P,B0BYSQDWRT,3.0 out of 5 stars Irritating when sweating but light weight,Jack Hubbard,3.0,"Id give this a higher rating based on comfort while wearing. Except when your busy working and sweating. This fl heat has got me sweating a lot out side. And the design shape has the sweat comming off my head right into my ears going down my ear canals. These are however much lighter than their banded bone conduction versions (Open Pro) . And much more comfortable when laying down. And there is virtually no sound thay can be heard by anyone next to you. My wife doesn't complain about these when Im listening to UTube/tic toc and shes laying next to me. Which she complained all the time with the Open Pro bone. The other reason for the 3 star, The microphone tends to get water logged from sweat or rain and then wont work. When it is working (dry) it is very sensitive to background noise. Not much for a noise canceling microphone.... The microphone needs a big improvement. Open pros are much better in that way. On the plus side battery life last a long while. Majority of the day depending on how many phone calls i have and how much im on U tube. But the chargeing case also has a battery reserve that will charge your headsets multiple times before it needs to be plugged in. So you can recharge your headsets in your pocket on the go.

R196PP8OMC7A1K,B0BYSQDWRT,2.0 out of 5 stars Not recommended due to issues with charging.,Matt K.,2.0,"I have used two different shokz bone conduction headphones in the past, starting with the aeropex and most recently had the openrun pro. Keeping my ears open while exercising outside is very important to me and those definitely delivered that. Sound quality however was never a strong suit of them and I found that overtime both started developing excess vibrations or rattling. Most recently the openrun pro has started vibrating a lot after some time of use while exercising, potentially from sweat between the driver and my skin. I also found them super comfortable to wear, but since both sides were connected, they were exactly compact.I only have a short time with the openfit, but I think I have a decent idea of some of the pros and cons as compared to the openrun pro.Pros:- Sound quality. Its a noticeable improvement over the openrun pro. Bass actually exists with these. Its still not top tier, but for an open ear product, I think its pretty good.- Still open ear. While it covers your ear a bit more it doesnt seem to block out much if any sound. Situational awareness seems to be just as good as the openrun. Obviously if you need isolation, these are not for you.- TWS. These are much smaller and more compact than the openrun since each ear is separated. Still have ear hooks, so I think they will be stable without any worries about losing one or the other.- Charging case. Having a compact case to carry them around with and provide extra battery life is nice.- USB C. The charging case charges via usb-c instead of a proprietary connector with the open run. No more worrying about having to bring a special cable.- Comfort. They are very comfortable to wear and very lightweight. No more loop around the back of your head getting in the way of things.Cons:- Comfort. Also a con since part of it has to actually protrude over your ear canal and its been more noticeable while wearing them while I could pretty easily forget that I was wearing the openrun pro. I expect I will get used to them, but I do find it a step down.- No multipoint. I use these with both my phone and my watch, and now have to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices. The openrun pro had multipoint and while my watch sometimes had issues connecting, I at least never had to manually go into pairing mode just to switch between devices.- Controls. There are touch controls on each earpiece. They can be customized which is nice, but by default volume control isnt enabled, and can only be enabled on long press, which is 3 seconds. It feels very long to hold down for 3 seconds for volume. Also due to the way they sit on the ear, it kind of puts pressure on the ear to press or tap these controls. The openrun pro had dedicated volume buttons and a dedicated play/pause button. I much preferred that. The openrun pro could also be turned on or off with the controls, cant do that on the openfit. Seems placing them in or out of the case is the only way to turn them off or even disconnect the bluetooth without disconnecting it from your phone or other device.I of course havent used them long enough to see how they hold up over time. But I expect since creating sound isnt based on vibrating against your head, quality should hopefully hold up and not start vibrating as both of my previous shokz products have through use. The sound quality improvement while still being open and keeping situational awareness is really nice.I havent tried phone calls with them yet, but I imagine they would be just as good as the openrun pro's which were great for that.A lot of good upgrades and overall I think the form factor could prove to be a lot better. But there are some noticeable steps back, so I am settling on 4 stars because the cons are enough for me to prevent a full 5. The app does allow for firmware updates though, and there was one available as soon as I turned them on. I imagine multipoint could conceivably be added (if the hardware supports it) or the controls could be further tweaked or expanded upon.Update 8/23/23 - Lowering to 3 stars. All the positives from above remain. The size is nice, they are compact. They sound good, especially compared to the openrun. Still have all the same situational awareness.But I find myself adjusting them quite often when using them. I have never had either side fall out while exercising, but they still dont feel as secure as the openrun ever did. They can bounce around just slightly when using them.I also find call quality doesnt seem to be as good when paired with my phone. Still quite usable, but not as crisp or clear as others.There have been a couple of firmware updates so far, but nothing that has allowed for more customization of the touch controls. A swipe motion to change volume like other tws earbuds have would be very welcome as an additional control. And the long press is still obnoxiously long.But the biggest issue is that I have started developing trouble charging one of the earbuds. It doesnt seem to reliably make contact with the charging case anymore. I use them pretty much every day, but I do feel like I may not be getting near the advertised battery, and find myself having to charge the case seemingly once a week, even though there is no way I am using them for nearly 30 hours a week. Might be an issue of the actual earbuds not seating or charging properly.And since the charging case is needed both to disconnect the openfit from my phone or other device and is needed to put them in pairing mode to switch between devices (since they have no multipoint), it has made them more and more difficult to use. I have had multiple instances where I cannot properly activate pairing mode to switch devices and have to try multiple times before it works. I Even had one night where I put them back in the case, but they never actually registered in the case so they just remained on and draining theirs and my phones battery overnight.I do not know if this is just from poor design or potentially from some stray sweat after working out with them, but if its the latter, these are advertised as water resistant and to be used for ""sport"" so this would seem like a possible failure point or issue. And I feel like now I am going to have to go through the hassle of getting a warranty replacement for a product.Update 8/28/23 - Back to 4 stars. The right earbud completely died on me and I could not get it to charge in the case. Though somehow I eventually managed to get it to charge again, and it seems that it is charging somewhat consistently again. I still sometimes have to reseat it or wiggle it to make sure its actually registered as being in the case.But the real reason I am back to 4 stars is because the latest firmware added multipoint. 2 devices can now be connected. And it seems to work pretty seamlessly. So I am quite happy with that. Weirdly it doesnt look like they have updated their product pages with this yet.I cannot tell if anything else has been changed with the latest firmware update as I cannot find any patch notes. The long press delay seems like it might be slightly shorter than before, but its still quite long. There wasnt even any mention of multipoint other than a new setting for it just appeared in the app after the firmware updated.At this point I think these would be 5 stars for me if they were able to update the gestures. Based on some other TWS I have used, single tap and swipe gestures are not available. And given the larger area of these, a swipe at least seems like it would be the best for volume control. Not sure if its possible with the hardware, and maybe the single tap was left out to prevent false activations while working out. At the very least, the long press still seems like it could be shortened.Update 3/4/24: Dropping down to 2 stars. I don't recommend these anymore. The replacement pair I received a while back after an annoying RMA process with spotty communication from shokz has now started to exhibit the same behavior the first pair exhibited.The right earpiece again is having issues charging properly on the charging case. It does not seem to make a solid connection in the case anymore. Not only does this mean that it doesn't always charge properly, but even worse the charging case is used to essentially turn them off. This means I can put it in the case and if I am not super careful, it will remain on, will not charge, and remain connected to my phone. I have now had multiple times where after a day I go to use them and the right earpiece is nearly dead. If this progresses as before, eventually it seems likely that the right earpiece won't be able to take a charge at all.Since this has happened again, and again to the right side, this feels like there must be some issue with these.The only thing I can think of is that I do use them when exercising and I do sweat, and have occasionally used them out in some light rain. But with an IP54 rating I assumed this shouldnt be an issue as this seems exactly like what that rating is designed for. I always wipe them dry before putting them in the charging case.I will be reaching out to support again to see what my options are and likely start looking for a replacement.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2023",AEQCXTASJGYHDKV5CGHKP5OQJRQA,1,489,Color: Black,"June 30, 2023",2023-06-30,2023-06,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

After contacting them they got me a replacement set quickly, and were extremely quick and professional. If I have any problems with the replacement pair, I'll update again, but for now, here's hoping the issues with the last pair were a fluke.I've been using these for about 6 months, and they get hours of use every single day. I use them on my computer when gaming, use them so watching videos on my phone don't bother my partner, and I also use them when I work out or go on walks.Compared to the other Shokz products that are bone-conduction, I would say the sound quality is certainly a bit better, though not quite at the level of a nicer, traditional headphone. Frankly, I don't mind that at all. Plus they are extremely comfortable. Maybe not quite as much as the OpenRun Pros, but still way more comfortable than ear buds for me.Here is my big problem. After 6 months of use, the bass had blown out on them pretty badly. Anytime I am listening to something with a decent amount of bass (even someone with a deep speaking voice) then suddenly my sound is tinny and pretty awful. I don't know if it is the hours of use every day or sweat from working out (they are supposed to be sweat resistant), but it is clear to me they are reaching the end of their life.If this issue was coming up after a couple years, which is the life I got out of my original pair of base-level, cheap Shokz (back when they were called Aftershockz). But I paid nearly $200 (after tax) for these, and I'm only getting half a year out of them!? I get that they don't make stuff last like they used to, but if an expensive pair of headphones can't even give me a year of solid use, then frankly that is a pretty big mark against them.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AE2NAMRY5WGQSIWF6372NFWEUWMA,1,1,Color: Black,"June 18, 2024",2024-06-18,2024-06,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

Very musical and smooth but they won't replace my Sennheiser Momentum 4 earbuds for focused music and listening. You shouldn't expect deep bass from an open earbud and the M4s just have the entire sound stage nailed. The control point on each bud is a small projection.

Played loud, they do distort, especially in the upper midrange, such as Jennifer Nettles (Sugarland) or Queen (Fat Bottomed Girls).

I absolutely despise having my ears closed to the world in most situations, so they have been a good fit for podcast/conference calls/general use. What they were never great at is audio quality for music.Shoz Open Fit solves that issue. Audio quality is very good, phone calls are crystal clear, and my ears remain open to hear my surroundings. Sound leakage is no greater than the bone conducting variants. No, these aren't super high end concert sound quality headphones...that's not their purpose. They are however very good quality sound for general use and casual music listening.The one thing to know for current Shokz users of bone conducting headphones. These will not work with ear plugs, as the audio does require an open ear canal. They are very different from other Shokz products in that regard. I am hanging onto my Shokz Open Run bone conducting headphones for using on the lawn mower, blowing leaves, etc., but they will be limited to those uses, as the Open Fit version has much better audio quality and are more comfortable to wear.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFNOI4G7FILMI6T7V3FXUDELQBTQ,1,0,Color: Black,"July 20, 2024",2024-07-20,2024-07,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

For once they are very comfortable, super light and I can't even feel them (this will vary with ear anatomy as my spouse finds them less comfortable than I do). They are very light and they fit very securely for me. The sound is way better than bone conduction while still allowing for situational awareness. The multipoint pairing works really well. If there is one thing that could be better is the touch sensors. Sometimes they don't respond when I want them to and sometimes they react to nothing and something starts playing when I grab the headphones to put them on.

R25SW3K0TYZVO2,B0BYSQDWRT,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect for me,jeprdy,4.0,"I‚Äôve had these for several months now and feel I can give a solid review. First, I have bought many different brands of wired & wireless earbuds, none of which fit well. The best fitting are also the most affordable but they do not hold up to my extensive use and they are wired (Panasonic Ergofit wired in-ear). I‚Äôve bought many, many pairs of these over the years and they cause me ZERO pain with hours of continuous wear. However, I need wireless. I‚Äôve tried several pair of wireless, cheap to top-of-the-line and all caused me pain and pressure sore spots in my ears. Out of frustration, I picked up a super-cheap pair of open ear style wireless buds and voila- my pressure point issues were finally solved! Since that set had poor sound quality and would disconnect while my phone was in my hand, I started shopping around for a better quality pair. I compared may brands of open ear buds and decided on this brand.The sound quality is stellar and the connection is superior. However, my pain issue is back, though not as persistent as in-ear wireless buds were for me. If I sweat, the buds will slip enough that it exerts some pressure on the ear and I have to adjust frequently due to pain from pressure. I have not gotten actual pressure wounds with these, so that‚Äôs a big plus for me.I do find myself looking for another pair from time to time, but to be honest I‚Äôm tired of failure after failure and these are the best wireless pair ive found. I think if the arm that wraps around the top & back of the ear were adjustable, I might be able to find a better fit, but for now I‚Äôll be keeping these.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AHZE7JASZSCLYI6HU2AK277AGM7Q,1,32,Color: Beige,"May 20, 2024",2024-05-20,2024-05,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

R2JQ755JAGQZR3,B0BYSQDWRT,"4.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight, Great Sound",T. James Smith,4.0,"I love how lightweight these are. I don't even feel them on my ears. They don't block the ear canal so even when wearing both earphones I can still hear everything around me.The audio itself is very clear. Bass is very good too, but obviously won't compare to over-the-ear headphones. The battery life is commendable, about 6-7 hours each earphone before needing a charge. Charging case doubles maybe triples that time.Audiobooks and podcasts sound great. I use them at work where I drive a forklift so when there is a lot of outside noise (cars driving by, forklift etc) it does get hard to hear and I usually have to max out the volume if I'm listening to a podcast or something. If it isn't too loud of an environment then they work great even on low volume.Somewhat water resistant. I accidently got into the shower with them on (that's how comfortable they are) but took them out as soon as I noticed. As long as you dry them thoroughly before using again they are going to be OK.No need to deal with earwax blocking up the earbud, no messing with sizes of rubber tips to fit my weirdly shaped ears.They work great individually and together. They both have their own microphones which allows me to switch them in and out all the while staying on my phone call. Everyone I've spoken with over the phone has told me my voice is perfectly clear. They do a good job at dampening outside sound on their side. Like when I'm driving a forklift and talking to someone at the same time, they barely hear the forklift even though it's too loud for me to hear them.I LOVE the multiconnect feature. This allows me to connect my earphones to my phone, then to whatever else I'm using. I've tried them on the Nintendo Switch, my smart tv, desktop pc, laptop, Meta Quest 2, and a Kindle Fire tablet with no issues.They are discreet. Most people don't realize I'm wearing them (including myself).Cons:Although the battery life is pretty good, taking a phone call will halve the battery life. On a phone call I get about 3-4 hours of time before needing to charge them. (This is easily circumvented if you just use one earphone at a time instead of both)The case is smallish and holds a good amount of charge, but is near impossible to open with one hand. Not a huge issue, but for anyone that has the other hand full or are disabled in that manner may find it difficult to open the case using only one hand.All in all these are an absolute must-buy for those looking to be constantly connected.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024",AG4I42DVCCOVWLSJ4IVCN3X7K2JA,1,15,Color: Black,"February 21, 2024",2024-02-21,2024-02,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

I returned these headphones and bought the $300 Bose ultra open ear headphones and those were. Total rip off. These headphones are actually better than those. So I ended up buying a not her pair. It must have been a faulty set or something because these work way better than the first set.Update: 8/1 the Bluetooth connectivity and battery life on the new set is awful might be defectiveDEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY YOU SHOULD GET THEM they work pretty well I can get 4-5 hours on continuous use per headphone the sound quality is significantly better and the battery!,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AHMPRQJDLLEVXCV34UHQFLJZ5KJQ,1,0,Color: Beige,"June 14, 2024",2024-06-14,2024-06,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

RR8364IQV2F4,B0BYSQDWRT,5.0 out of 5 stars Pleased with replacement set,PFC-Wintergreen,5.0,"I initially left a negative review because I had a bad pair and hadn't heard back from Shokz even though it was long past the time period they said they would respond.However, they did eventually send a replacement set and it is much better than my first pair. They didn't even ask me to send my original pair back. Sound quality is great for the type of tech used with the ability to hear your surroundings at the same time. Bass is much better than their bone conduction headphones, and microphone quality is also good. Overall I'm very happy with the product post-replacement.Original review below:____________________I love Shokz bone conduction headphones. I've spent hundreds on them; on my pair, and gifting pairs to others.But I'm very disappointed with the OpenFit. First of all, my pair has a ""blown out speaker"" effect that seems to have worsened over time. Even deep voices on podcasts can sound distorted at as little as 50 percent volume. I know that some distortion is to be expected at high volumes with bass heavy content, due to the technology used for these. What I'm experiencing is not a subtle limitation like that; the bass is just completely distorted and unlistenable at anything but the lowest volume.More importantly, Shokz support does not respond to my support requests, even though it's been more than double their expected response window.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2024",AG3DFMCXOWIFULZE7RVM4VNOJ3PA,1,1,Color: Black,"May 22, 2024",2024-05-22,2024-05,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

Safety wise, the bone conductors are likely a better choice, but I am happy to have these as a backup (or who knows, they may become the primary goto's when on the bike).

I got a chance to try these on in an airport, but they were much more expensive.I've had these for a little over a month. They stay on great when running at my faster paces, great for bike rides near the road. You can crank them with music and it will drown out outside noise a bit more, with spoken word (audio books, podcasts, shows) it's a bit less effective but still good even in a crowded gym.One challenge I've had is that sometimes the case will open slightly, the earbuds unseat and then can run the battery down since they're actively connected. I just keep them in the small cloth bag they provided with it now while they're in my bag and that hasn't happened again.Overall if you're someone who likes the ""hook"" design for headphones, and wants to try open ear or non-eartip designs these are a great fit.Obviously - not great for airplanes.

R1W33N9O1DZFZ8,B0BYSQDWRT,5.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds I‚Äôve ever owned,doc2021,5.0,"I‚Äôve had these for about 3 weeks and WOW they are the best. When I first got them I put them in so tightly that they put pressure against the back of the inside of my ear, which was uncomfortable over time. I think I‚Äôm so used to always feeling my headphones in my ear that this initially felt like the correct way to wear them. The key to prevent this is to gently put them on so they are just resting. Here is the best way I can describe it:1) When you twist the arm back over the top of your ear, twist it all the way back as far as it can go to where you run out of room and it puts pressure on the top and back of the earbud (part that is inside the ear). The back is almost pointed down at this point.2) Give the whole earbud about a quarter turn forward.3) Pull the inside of the earbud away from your head just a bit, then re-situate it so it‚Äôs gently resting in your ear.I can wear them like this for hours. It will feel weird at first like they‚Äôre going to fall out, but you‚Äôll get used to it! They are so comfortable at that point that sometimes when I‚Äôve stopped listening to something, I have to actually reach up and feel to make sure I‚Äôve put them back in the case. There have been multiple times where I feel for them and they aren‚Äôt there. Like I literally can‚Äôt tell the difference. Your hearing is also not impaired, meaning you can turn down whatever you‚Äôre listening to and have a full conversation with someone without issue. It also IMO makes them safer to wear in public. They are great to talk on the phone with too, and the microphone works very well. Lastly, I worked out in them the other day doing a combination of weight lifting and cardio (including jumping exercises). I have somewhat oddly shaped ears so I‚Äôm usually having to adjust even the best headphones constantly while doing any physical activity. I was shocked to realize I didn‚Äôt so much as touch these the entire time!! For the first time I was about to forget about my headphones completely and focus on my workout.

I bought these because I thought I lost my open coms, which I then found the day after these were delivered. I have never used a pair of headphones as long or as frequently as I did the open coms but after using these for a day the open coms are now my work headset thanks to the USB dongle they sell separately. These blow away the open coms in sound quality, comfort, and appearance by miles while not compromising situational awareness in the slightest which is the main point of these headphones. The open coms have a slight advantage on mic quality (thanks to the boom mic) and a serious advantage on battery life. I can still mostly get a full day of use out of these earphones so battery life isn‚Äôt a huge deal but I‚Äôm typically charging them once through out the day for 15 minutes or so. The open coms on the other hand would make it nearly 2 full days without a charge and with near constant use. For traditional headphone usage I‚Äôd give these an 8-9 out of 10 and a 6 out of 10 for strictly a communication accessory. For the open coms flip that rating. Both are phenomenal units if you want to maintain an awareness of your surroundings but they still have different strengths so chose accordingly. Overall though highly recommend these guys.

R18W2ELF7NOJGE,B0BYSQDWRT,4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly good sound quality without compromising situational awareness.,Deb X,4.0,"I can't use earbuds because I have stitches in my ear tract, and the earbuds feel horrible. Aftershoks has been the best headphone choice ever since my surgery in 2018.I recently upgraded my Trek Air (2018 model) to OpenFit. Here are the improvements:- Even lighter, I can have OpenFit on the whole day while working. I sometimes forget it's there.- The fit is great for me. Putting them on is not the most intuitive, but once it's on, it stays there.- The sound quality is way better than my old Aftershoks. It felt like surround sounds, and I could still hear my partner talking clearly while blasting music.- The mic quality has also greatly improved. It's clear and loud. The old model used to get interference from water and high-pitched sounds, but this one doesn't.Now the 4-stars:- Because of the design of these things. If your environment is too noisy, you inherently will not be able to hear well what's coming from your headphones. Usually, in that situation, I'll use my Bose over-ear headphones.- Although the phone app allows you to customize your controls, but it's quite limited, and you just in generally have to give up one of the 3 basic control: play/stop, fastforward/backward, and volume control. Though I have a feeling this can be a software improvement in the future.- The tap control is also not consistent. And the feedback is an in headphone beep, I'd rather it be a small vibration","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AHPN3OFJ7FITU7H4OJD4J7USCOFQ,1,2,Color: Black,"February 11, 2024",2024-02-11,2024-02,Shokz,Shokz OpenFit - Open-Ear Headphones

R2LMILI3XYE6DJ,B0B2SH4CN6,4.0 out of 5 stars About perfect for wireless headphones.,Crank,4.0,"For what they are, I think the device is well-engineered. The Pro 2s are high-quality earbuds. You really kind of need the Samsung app for the equalizer and the various settings you get with touch and sound, so make sure to get it. Without the app, I wouldn't really think they are the best choice. But most people will be using these with Galaxy phones. Equalizers per music player, such as VLC, are much better so be sure to use that if you have it to get the best sound.These buds are lighter compared to the previous Pro model. A huge plus. They fit perfectly in my ear almost, and they don't really seem like they will fall out even when running or working harder than normal. I will have to test them for longer lengths of time. So far so good.The packaging and contents are very simple: you get three sets of tips, though, the middle ones are default and worked great, with one smaller cord to charge the magnetic box for storage. It's a grippier, matte texture for the box too. Mine came in a simple plastic bag from Amazon.It is highly recommended you download the Wear app from Samsung. Once you have that they are very easy to set up, and you can constantly monitor whatever you need to with ease. Warranty and registration were a bit harder than I would have liked, but it's doable, not that the warranty is very long on these. You only get a year, and everybody should realize these cannot take many falls. They are very sensitive, so make sure they fit your ears!The features on these are pretty killer all told. I usually turn noise-cancellation off, as it uses too much battery, and I don't really want or need that kind of thing. Ambient sensors when talking are awesome, and the normal isolation is a good space between something like Etymotic in-ear headphones and Sennheiser open-backs. You can fiddle with settings to get your preferences for how you touch and manipulate the device. I found my preferences were quite easy to set up, and the whole thing took about ten minutes.I had no issues with sensitivity on the touch panel area of the earbuds. Works great for me. I do wish these came with a better equalizer, but the Clear setting is probably the most balanced. These are way too bassy out of the gate, and the response is definitely not flat. The Clear setting reduces the bass a bit for a more neutral and even setting with a touch of added treble. I just wish they would let us direct our own EQ options though. Seems like it would be a pretty easy addition to the software. Volume wasn't overpowering at max, but I think it did the job. Again, this is nothing like an amped pair of open-back headphones, so don't expect concert-level sound.AKG has engineered these fairly well in the product space. I'd put them up there with some decent midrange in-ear headphones like the Etymotic ER3XR. There is no way these will compete with any decent open-backs like a Sennheiser HD600 when amped, but I didn't expect that. For what they are, they do the job well, look and feel nice, and the new matte texture is vastly superior and more premium than the first Pro by a mile.All told, if you want to go the wireless earbud route, these are a top option with very few competitors when you take in the whole experience. They won't replace my normal wired headphones at all, but they might be a godsend at work when I just need to chill out and listen to some tunes without the bother of lugging my phone around and wires getting in the way.I don't recommend using these things for hours at a time. There is a serious lack of scientific knowledge on the amount of low-dose radiation over long periods of time. RF, EMR, et cetera. A lot of newer, independent science is starting to find anomalies with oxidation with lower doses and non-ionizing radiation in general. SAR data so far still uses fairly old standards, and though these are a little less powerful in specific absorption rate than a high-end phone, most wear them for WAY longer than that while directly in your ear.If you do need some quality in-ear wireless buds, these are definitely an option to consider. Their SAR data was slightly below the Airpod levels at least. All in all you can't do much better for your wireless audio needs.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2022",AH3ICCTF4GUQ75BASLIXFJLPXLQA,1,139,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"October 31, 2022",2022-10-31,2022-10,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

The case feels a little cheap and doesn't feel very durable, but as long as you're careful you're fine. The fit of them, however, is a big problem for people like me who have very greasy ears. The silicon ear tips easily slide out and don't seal completely. I fixed this by ordering memory foam tips, and I've never looked back.The noise canceling is... OK. It's really not amazing unless I turn whatever I'm listening to up very loud. This is painfully apparent on something like a plane.

R3KY6YLZJVUZIB,B0B2SH4CN6,3.0 out of 5 stars Not a great fit and touch sensitivity is not great,Dezzi Smith,3.0,"I bought these as a replacement for my galaxy buds live, which I used for a couple years. I loved them but just figured I would upgrade.The look of the Buds2 Pro is very sleek and better than the live. They're not glossy like the live and the overall design just looks better. However, I had a hard time getting these to fit snug in my ears. When I would finally get them to fit nicely, any movement of my head would loosen them. When I would try to adjust them, obviously I would end up pausing or playing my audio when I didn't want to because I had to touch the ear buds. I just figured maybe my ears needed to get used to them like the buds live. About a month later I'm still struggling with getting them to fit.One feature that I love about the galaxy buds is that I don't have to pause my audio to take them out. I can just take them out of my ears and it will automatically pause. However, with these, I would notice that my audio was still playing when I took them out. I listen to podcasts during the day while I work. I usually only wear one at a time so I can still hear my phone ringing or hear people talking to me. Occasionally I would need to take my ear bud out to answer the phone or talk to someone so I would just set it on my desk in front of me until I could pick it back up. It's easier than trying to put it back in the case for just a minute or 2. Well a lot of the time, I would notice that my ear bud was still playing while it was sitting on my desk in front of me. So, I would have to pause my podcast, take the ear bud out, then make sure my podcast stayed paused. My touch when taking it out would cause it to start playing again. But I couldn't figure out a way to take it out without touching it in a way that would play it.These ear buds are nice and I'm sure they work for people that plan on wearing them for long stretches without taking them in and out. I'm going back to my galaxy buds live and maybe I'll try a different pair another time.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AF67OV74JJEQLEO5D2NPMHB3ALNA,1,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"June 11, 2024",2024-06-11,2024-06,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

I was on the fence between Sony and Samsung but I figured that Samsung has probably optimized these to work with an Android platform phone and it certainly seems so. The bass is just a touch off of perfect but everything else is spot on. As soon as I popped them in my ears - my YouTube music kicked on immediately and I've been immersed in music for 2 hours now with no complaints!

You can barely leave the room before it starts disconnecting and getting static. That part actually sucks to be honest.

R30QH4E5NOMRKO,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars In love with my new Buds,S. Strand,5.0,"These are my first pair of 'unwired' buds. Was using a Bose model previously. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+, so setting these up was a snap. I literally opened the case and they connected to my phone. I love all of the options for controlling the buds, noise control, voice detect, 360 audio, etc. - they all work spectacularly. The case is the charger which is kinda cool, you can charge the case without the buds and charge the buds without the case being plugged in. They come with different sized covers so you can use the ones that fit your ears the best, and the fit test in the app is a great feature. I do wish they had wings though, I've always had a hard time getting buds to stay in my ears. Overall, I do love them (especially the color ;) ).Couple of minor things to note - obviously none of these were deal breakers for me: 1. The touch sensors are exactly that - touchy. When adjusting them in my ears it's very easy to accidentally change a setting. On the bright side, it's pretty easy to change it back. 2. You can't connect to 2 devices at once, i.e.; phone and laptop. My old buds did and would switch to the active device, so kind of missing that. Connecting them to devices other than the phone is pretty simple, however, and once set up it's just hitting 'Connect' and you're good to go. 3. The charging cable is USB-C to USB-C. I don't have a USB-C compatible charging block and don't want to keep them plugged into my laptop, so I found a USB to USB-C cable and use that. No issues. 4. They are a little uncomfy when trying to get them to sit in my ears correctly. But once seated they do stay pretty snug and I hardly notice them. I use them when running/working out and they haven't fallen out yet. Although I did almost lose one down the garbage disposal today, so take that with a grain of salt 5. SmartThings App. I installed this based on some troubleshooting I was doing with a knockoff pair I bought (didn't realize they were knockoffs at the time). When installed it automatically connected my earbuds to my phone and if I was running my mobile hotspot, it would automatically disconnect the hotspot. A serious pain in the ass since I use that for meetings‚Ä¶ it was driving me batty so I uninstalled it. It's not a necessary app for legit buds. 6. I connected these to my laptop and had issues with sound cutting in and out. Found out it is usually related to an out of date Bluetooth driver. So if you are connecting to your laptop and the sound cuts in and out, update your Intel Bluetooth driver - should fix the issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AG4IQ3C7VKE3USVUNWLWNWGJTJEQ,1,29,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"August 23, 2023",2023-08-23,2023-08,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro
RR4ZWFXCWAB2D,B0B2SH4CN6,3.0 out of 5 stars Solid earbuds,Robby,3.0,"The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer some impressive features, but they come with a few drawbacks. On the positive side, the noise-cancelling is effective, and the sound quality is clear with good bass. The 360 Audio feature is an interesting addition, enhancing the overall listening experience. Comfort-wise, they fit snugly in the ear, but do like to slip out sometimes. The IPX7 water resistance is a great bonus for active users.However, there are a few areas where the earbuds fall short. The battery life is average and doesn‚Äôt quite meet the expectations set by other high-end models. Additionally, the touch controls can be overly sensitive or unresponsive at times, leading to which can be frustrating. The price point might feel a bit steep for what‚Äôs offered, especially given the competition in the market.

Perfect sync with all my devices,Oscar Berrios,5.0,"The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro are a great pair of wireless earbuds for anyone looking for a combination of excellent sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC), and a comfortable fit. They are also one of the few pairs of earbuds that support the new Bluetooth LE Audio standard, which offers improved audio quality and lower latency.**Sound quality**The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro produce excellent sound quality. They have a balanced sound profile with good bass response, clear mids, and crisp highs. The soundstage is also quite wide, which gives the music a sense of space.**ANC**The ANC on the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro is very effective. It blocks out most ambient noise, even in noisy environments. This makes them ideal for use on airplanes, buses, or trains.**Fit and comfort**The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro are very comfortable to wear. They are lightweight and have a secure fit. They also come with a variety of ear tips to choose from, so you can find the perfect fit for your ears.**Features**The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro come with a variety of features, including:* Bluetooth LE Audio support for improved audio quality and lower latency* Active noise cancellation (ANC)* Transparency mode for hearing your surroundings* Spatial audio for a more immersive listening experience* Voice assistant support (Google Assistant, Bixby, Siri)* Touch controls for playback, volume, and ANC**Battery life**The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro have a battery life of up to 5 hours on a single charge with ANC enabled. The charging case can provide an additional 18 hours of battery life. This means that you can easily get through a full day of use without having to recharge the case.**Overall**The Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro are a great pair of wireless earbuds for anyone looking for a combination of excellent sound quality, active noise cancellation, a comfortable fit, and a variety of features. They are also a good option for people who are looking for earbuds that support the new Bluetooth LE Audio standard.**Pros:*** Excellent sound quality* Effective ANC* Comfortable and secure fit* Bluetooth LE Audio support* Variety of features* Good battery life**Cons:*** Can be expensive* Touch controls can be a bit finickyIf you are looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro.

Sound quality was mid at best. I have a budget pair of buds that blow these away. These sounded tinny and hollow with no richness unlike my budget buds.2. There is no volume control on the buds so if you put your phone down or put it in your pocket there is no way to adjust the sound.3. You can only select the off position for the ANC from the ap, the buds only offer pass through or ANC on.Final thoughts : You can get better sounding buds with much better controls for a fraction of the retail cost of these.

Case is small enough to easily fit in your pocket. Case also shows charge level on your wearable app. Pictures show size comparison to typical ""credit"" cards. They do sound pretty good compared to the original buds anyway. They have nice features in the app as well, you can change what taps and long holds do as well as an edge double tap for volume down for left and up for right. Not bad I'm happy with them. Only qualm I have is they aren't compatible with the wing tips to stay in your ears better and are basically a press fit.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AGS4G3XSRKKKXNHGVJQIEJEYJZBQ,1,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"April 21, 2024",2024-04-21,2024-04,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

R2R1WB0JDING7Z,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars I think I'm in Love,AB,5.0,"I've had these Buds 2 Pro for a few days now and I'm in love with them. I paired them to a Samsung S22 Ultra, so they work together like peas and carrots.HEAD TRACKING: I like the head tracking feature. If you turn your head away from your media the sound increases in the bud that is closest to your device. Keeps the sound focused in the direction of the device. It's rather neat.FIT: I had to change the earpieces out to the smallest right away, but it's important that you get a good fit.They don't bulge from my ears much. Just a bit. There is ""Check fit"" area in the Samsung App.ANC: The noise cancelling is pretty amazing. Actually makes you appreciate the silence when you turn it on. Very close to perfect silence.AMBIENT SOUND: When you switch to ambient sound, the best way to describe it is like a hearing aid. Everything seems a bit loud at first, but you can hear what's going on around you once you get used to it. You don't realize how much white noise is in your environment until you switch off ANC.VOICE DETECTION: I'm not sure if I like the voice detection so much. When you start singing along with the music, your sound decreases until you remember to turn it off. It works well if you're in an office environment and want to lower the audio if you are talking but the shortest return time is 5 seconds if voice is detected. I wish there were a shorter time. Turning on the ambient sound can also be enough. The jury is still out on that feature.TOUCH CONTROLS: The touch controls are responsive, but I wish I could change the taps to customize it more. I might want to switch between noise cancelling and ambient sound or change the volume, but I can only do one or the other with the current setup. It wasn't a deal breaker for me.COMFORT: They're comfortable enough for me to have in my ears for an extended period of time with the correct sized earpiece. They're easy to insert, but button presses are inevitable when inserting them. They sync right up to my Samsung phone and watch.FASHION: My ears are quite small, so the tiny ends were my choice. They don't bulge out of my ear too much. Just a little, really. Sometimes I can hear my hair brush the buds and a wet head has tripped a button press, but it hasn't been a deal breaking issue. Just something to be aware of.I haven't tried using these in bed, which will probably happen at some point as I like to catch up on shows when I can't sleep, so I can't speak for comfort if you lay on one ear while using them.OVERALL : Fit is good. Sound is nice. They're very responsive and easy to use. I'd recommend them to any Samsung user for compatibility and interoperability. I think I'd get these even if I used something other than Samsung, though. They're well made and the texture is rubber-like so they're easy to handle. Case can charge wirelessly, which is a convenient plus.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2023",AEDZG63RE35BTYYIVOFECPY4TF5Q,1,146,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"January 7, 2023",2023-01-07,2023-01,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

The sound quality is great, but the product as a whole is not the greatest I've owned from Samsung.Battery Life: If you use any of the special features like noise cancellation or ambient sound amplification, you will cut the battery life in two. This is normally not so much of a problem when I go for a two hour run, but when I am working in my garage for 5 - 6 hours, they die before my work is over. Also, unlike previous versions, this earbuds will not give you a sound warning, they will just die.Touch Sensitivity: The one thing that drives me crazy. You will tap these earbuds time after time, after time, and nothing... Previous versions were much more sensitive to touch, which was good if you wanted skip songs, pause/play, etc.Overall, they are good earbuds, but I feel Samsung took a step in the wrong direction compared to the Galaxy Buds 2.

R23EVEQK7Z967S,B0B2SH4CN6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works good on calls, at least for me",Wade Burchette,4.0,"I bought these only because I needed something that let me talk while working, but still keep my hands free. I have a need to work on equipment while talking to various companies tech support lines. While a speakerphone does allow me to hear them, it does not help them to hear me. I did not buy this for music, because my cheap wired headphones with a USB-C connector deliver better music quality due to those pesky laws of physics. (It should be illegal for phones to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack.) Despite how they look, for me they work just fine for calls. However, I can see their design would also cause them not to work for some people. Be prepared to return them if that is the case.Setting up the earpiece was relatively straightforward. Since I already have a Samsung phone, I decided on these. The Galaxy wearable app opened, and the process started. It included 3 difference sized earpieces, and the app said each one was not a good fit. So I stuck with the medium sized piece.By default noise cancellation was on. But this quickly gave me a terrible headache. 5 minutes with these in and noise cancellation going was enough to give me a headache for the rest of the day. I turned off noise cancellation the next day and I didn't get a headache. I think I got motion sickness due to the noise cancellation.I haven't tested the battery life. These headphones are for work, not music. I only did a limited test in music quality, again because my only concern is telephone conversations. For that, they work fine for me.Update: I finally tested the music for this. The quality was good enough, but clearly inferior to a cheap set of wired headphones. Also, the delay in bluetooth is evident in videos if you look close enough. The lack of physical buttons is a serious issue. While working outside, a gnat got in my ear and to get it out, I had to touch an earpiece which paused the music. I found myself frequently accidentally touching them; very aggravating. Although it was nice to be able to work outside a few feet away from my phone. Kept my phone from getting damaged. None of the advantages outweigh the advantages of a proper headphone jack, but it is a nice ALTERNATIVE in certain situations.Also, irreplaceable batteries should be very very illegal, even for tiny headphones like this.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023",AFB66A2UCVKAUAASM32TUIF2C3JQ,1,16,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"July 1, 2023",2023-07-01,2023-07,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro
R3N59RGOLKIES1,B0B2SH4CN6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound. Software is not quite at ""pro"" level.",Jason,4.0,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. These are fantastic sounding. End of story. If you are looking for sound quality out of a wireless set of earbuds, you can almost just stop here and be fine.My smaller issue is the fit. They fit pretty well, but aren't staying in for longer periods of time. I feel like I'm always re-adjusting them. I will have to see if comply foam tips will fit as those will probably help resolve that issue.My bigger issue is actually the software. God forbit any one company get things right. I've had Sennheiser Momentums that sounded really good, but over time died so I moved on to the venerable Sony XM3's. They were really nice, but you couldn't adjust the volume like you could with the Sennheisers. Ok fine, their software allowed for a lot of customization though. I won't ever go back to Sony's though as the battery life on those is absolutely terrible. Not when they're new. But after only about a year the XM3's wouldn't hold a charge. I thought moving to the XM4's would help, but alas, after a year they wouldn't hold a charge either. Not sure what Sony is doing battery wise, but they need to do something else.So I moved on from the Sony's to these. Right away, I liked the sound of these so much more. But the software, while nice, is not very friendly when it comes to customizing them. You can't set anything to be whatever you want. You can't set the left and right to do individual things. My left is set to where if I hold it the earbuds go from ANC to Ambient sound and vice versa. The right side is set to go between Normal and ANC. But you can't set one side to go through the three settings (like you can on Sony). Why? This seems nonsensical. Also, with the Sony's I could have them connected to two devices at once and it would just play whichever device was being used. Not these.While I highly recommend them for sound quality, the software, while looking good, is actually weird and a little clunky. To me, it's not quite PRO level. Maybe some future updates will get it there though.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2023",AFGN67F34G52AW46JQAUKPPBNDRQ,1,17,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"August 10, 2023",2023-08-10,2023-08,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

That said the ear tips come in 3 sizes but seem to be outside the normal sizes I'm used to with every other earbud I've ever bought which is many. In Samsung I'm somewhere between large and medium. I use the large as they keep the buds in my ears. The medium come out after a while. The other issue I have is these love to dissconnect when I move away from the case. I suffered this issue with my cheap pair which is why I moved to a higher end bud with the stated promise these wouldn't do that. Yet here I am at work halfway to another department and no audio because I'm not carrying the case with me....Other than these issues the soundstage is huge the head tracking is neat and the sound itself is amazing.

It's not perfect, but they are small buds compared to over the ear noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is good, no complaints from people I'm calling about my microphone.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.I was happy to learn you can connect these buds like any Bluetooth speaker or headphones. If you read the slim instructions with the buds, they direct you to download the app. I did. I uninstalled the app in about 5 minutes.The app requires that you be permitted to access your entire phone - all of it. Call logs, contacts, SMS, and more. IMHO, the app is a dark dank hole that wants access to everything. I did find one feature that requires the app to turn it on. I'll live without that feature.Now, they work great! Seriously nice. They fit well, they have a great sound. They came with a little box of replacement earbud tips (it might have been nice if they were labeled).Another SERIOUSLY GREAT feature is that if you have a compatible phone, you can charge your earbuds on the back of your phone wirelessly.I had to look up the various taps and what they did online. I assume the app would have explained those functions.If Samsung reads this, change the app! I don't want to make a phone call or send a text message with earbuds.

R1TMMXO3INSIOG,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars A journey from Galaxy Buds+ to Galaxy Buds 2 to Galaxy Buds 2 Pro,Jenna Rhine,5.0,"So here is an initial Day 1 review.I started with the Galaxy Buds+ and was ""generally"" happy. The sound quality was excellent, the volume decent, the phone calls were acceptable and the fit was comfortable and stayed in place (for about 30 minutes) My biggest problem was the ""wings."" They helped the buds stay in place but due to the design, they tended to rotate since they were only being aligned by a tiny plastic nub. And once the wings rotated the fit was horrible.So I eventually upgraded to the Galaxy Buds 2. These also sounded very good, better in fact than the Galaxy Buds+. The calls and audio volume were similar, so perfectly functional. But now I had noise cancelling and a brand new form factor! The noise cancelling worked great for my needs. I'm not flying all over the country, but they nicely limited the white noise of public spaces. Unfortunately the fit was even worse. The Galaxy Buds 2 were slightly oblong in comparison to the Buds+, which I believed would be the answer to the ""wandering wings"" and finally give me the stable fit I'd been looking for. Alas, this was not the case. The only way the buds would stay in my ear is from a friction fit of the cushions in my ear canal. Not comfortable! And if I spoke or chewed food, it was only a matter of seconds before they had worked themselves loose. In every way except fit, the Galaxy Buds 2 were a definite upgrade.Now we arrive at the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. I have had them for about 5 hours and here are my initial impressions:- Getting them in the right orientation took me some time (probably because I'd been historically wearing ear buds goofy just to try to get them to stay in my ear.)- Once I had the ear buds in correctly, the fit was surprisingly comfortable and ""light"" feeling. At first I questioned whether they were positioned properly (the ambient noise being on also added to the idea.) When I turned off the ambient noise I realized how well the buds were fitting.- Chewing and speaking did not disrupt the fit at all!- The ANC worked as expected.- The sound was EXCELLENT in comparison to the previous Buds+ and Buds 2. I found the Buds 2 Pro to be louder, crisper and punchier than the previous earbuds.That's it for now. I'm cautiously optimistic about my purchase and I will follow up in a few weeks with more review. Moving forward I'll be focusing on how easy/hard it will be to quickly position the buds in and how much I end up ""messing with them"" while wearing them.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2023",AH4CNC6Z3U3ET6E4POKZ2TH2XQMQ,1,93,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only,"January 5, 2023",2023-01-05,2023-01,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro

R1CAWU66LVOUA3,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Jabra Elite 7 Pro vs 75t and Galaxy Buds+,Alexander,3.0,"I recently bought Jabra 7 Elite Pros in addition to Jabra 75t's and Galaxy Buds+ that I already own, so I'll compare them in this review against each other.Comfort-wise, I did find Jabra 7 to be more comfortable than 75t and much more comfortable than Galaxy Buds+ (small ears). J7 is the clear winner in comfort department for me.Case. At first I liked it. But only after some use I realized how inconvenient it is to open with one hand, especially when your skin gets a little bit dry and there's absolutely not enough grip on the lid and no notch to hold on to. Many people also report frequently dropping the case when trying to open it with one hand. This is actually a problem that is exclusive to Elite 7 because neither 75t nor Galaxy Buds+ have it.Sound-wise I'm not an expert, but I like the way they sound. But then again, I also like the way 75t's sound as well as Galaxy Buds+.Simultaneous connection to two devices: I bet galaxy buds, and Sony users don't even realize how great it is to connect to your PC and phone at the same time. Both Jabra 7 and 75t's can be connected to two devices (although only one is allowed to play sound at any given time) and that's a fundamentally important feature that most other wireless headphones lack.Single earpiece use: Jabra 7 has better support of using earpieces individually compared to 75t's: you can listen to either the left one or the right one, when 75t's allows you to use only the right one individually. Galaxy buds can work with either too. So 75t's lose their point here.My right earbud initially had some sort of a clicking sound when I chewed, but that seems to have fixed itself after a couple days.One of the most important aspects for me is the treadmill test: can any of them withstand daily intense running? Galaxy buds keep falling out of my ears and pinch the inner part of my ear with their wing tips. Also annoyingly whenever I try to fix them in place, their touch controls keep triggering which is infinitely frustrating. 75t's withstood more than a year of treadmill abuse from me, they performed well enough, but ultimately sweat did kill them: their sound started dipping when pressure inside the ear changed and later on sound almost disappeared. Jabra 7 Elite Pro seem to fit me the best: they sit very tight and they are comfortable while running. I'm yet to find out how long they will last.Buttons/controls. 75t's have very good physical buttons that you never activate by accident and they're light enough to respond without pushing the thing into your brain. Galaxy buds have touch controls which in my opinion is a huge design flaw because it keeps triggering whenever you want to fix the earpiece's position in your ear. Jabra 7's buttons are much more rigid and require more force to be pushed. It's not too bad, but I think I prefer 75t's controls that are softer.Stability. I never had any software/firmware problems with 75t's or galaxy buds, but J7's greeted me with a stalled green light on the case (not supposed to happen) and a whole bunch of jumping through the hoops to update them (it refused to go according to plan). While I managed to pull it through, I bet some people would have just sent them back already in frustration.So, the verdict. Is it worth upgrading from 75t's? Unless they're broken, probably not. Is it worth upgrading over Galaxy Buds+? I'd say, yes, because connecting to two devices at the same time becomes an essential feature once you start using it. Heck, I'd upgrade just because of how much more comfortable they are.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2022",AF7U2YCLSPQGE35DI26R5F2KDP5A,1,22,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"August 23, 2022",2022-08-23,2022-08,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R1YB1DWN94HZ3X,B09D1HMBQ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great. Some design issues",Alex M,4.0,"I bought these earbuds after returning a pair of Bose Sport Earbuds due to terrible microphone quality. I saw that these had better reviews for phone calls, and I was willing to try a different brand.What I liked:-BUTTONS. I love the physical buttons, which are much easier to use than touch controls. Especially when my hands are busy or wet (like washing dishes), its easy to just rock my head to the side and press the buttons to pause.-The sound quality was good. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I'm happy.-The case has wireless charging, which was a nice addition.-The earbuds have a good fit that isn't too uncomfortable after a while of listening.-The app is of higher quality than the Bose and Sony one is, at least it seemed intuitive to me.What was 'meh':-I bought these earbuds for the supposed better call quality, but the microphone sounds mediocre on the other end. It doesn't fare well at all in strong winds either. It's still better than the Bose, but I was a little disappointed by the microphone performance, considering the reviews. I mainly just use cheap wired earbuds with a microphone for better call quality.-The ANC that was added from a software update doesn't do anything. I've tested it on a noisy bus, and a loud gym, and I can't hear any difference between the 'off' and the 'ANC' modes. I just keep it in 'off' mode all the time, and I haven't seen any appreciable battery drain.-There's a 'sidetone' feature enabled by default that's meant to help you hear yourself when you're in a call, but it is just an annoying echo. You can turn it off in the app.What I didn't like:-The case is made of slippery plastic that's hard to open one handed. Even with two hands, you have to press in the top of the case to open it. Because of the symmetrical design of the case, its also hard to tell what is the top, bottom, or front of the case without directly looking at it. It makes the case annoying to hold and work with, and I've already dropped it twice, scattering the earbuds on the floor.-The software can be buggy. When I'm watching YouTube videos, occasionally, I'll resume the video after pausing, only to hear no sound. The volume is on, and no sound from any app plays. The only way to fix this is to put the earbuds back in the case then take them out.In short, these earbuds are a good product, but with some flaws that could be fixed in the next iteration. I'm happy enough that I got these at a slight discount by timing the order, but I still feel I overpaid for the quality I got. I wouldn't buy these at 'full price'. Still happier than if I kept the Bose though.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2022",AFWQ4DZ47NCIG4ALASFQYJSAAG2A,1,4,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"April 10, 2022",2022-04-10,2022-04,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R2R1087MQNV522,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars My Favorite Ear Buds,Alex Ruiz,4.0,"Update: after a few weeks of use, the microphone appears to not be working as well as when I first purchased. Seems to be a common issue with no real fix from what I‚Äôve read. People have trouble hearing me speak, sounding like I am far away, which is disappointing to say the least, so I‚Äôm knocking off 1 star, as they are still great for music.I had a pair of Elite 75t ear buds in 2020 that I absolutely loved. I originally used with them with a Samsung phone and I (begrudgingly) switched to Apple in 2021 with no issues. I hadn‚Äôt tried any other ear buds at that point and didn‚Äôt feel the need to. The fit, sound and call quality were perfect for my needs. As is usually the case with my luck, the Summer of 2022 I left my 75t‚Äôs soaking in my jeans for a few hours, which pretty much ruined them. Having switched to using an iPhone, I allowed myself to be convinced to get AirPods. As this is a Jabra review, I won‚Äôt go into details about the AirPods other than I was not impressed with everything about them, especially the fit and should have returned them immediately.Fast forward to Summer 2023, with my AirPods needing to be replaced because the right ear bud constantly buzzes, I opted to switch back to Jabra with the Elite 7 Pro‚Äôs and I have to say I‚Äôm happy I made the switch back. Fit was a big complaint with the AirPods, and the Jabra‚Äôs fit like a glove, never needing to be adjusted or feel like they are falling out even during intense exercise. Sound and call quality again is perfect for my needs. I work out a lot and work construction and I use my ear buds for phone calls quite frequently, so the water and dust proof ratings as well as the better mic are what convinced me to go with the 7 Pros this time. I completely forgot how good the battery life was as well compared to AirPods.The thing I like the most is definitely the fit, so if fit has ever been an issue with ear buds, I recommend giving the Elite 7 Pro‚Äôs, or Jabra ear buds in general, a try.

R2VDT74ZW5D7ID,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Dissapointed,curtasian,3.0,"I was trying to replace a Plantronics ELITE16 mono headset. Overall these would have been good if it weren't for a couple glaring problems.The Pros:*They fit very well, once you get used to them. I don't think that was due to any issues with the earbuds, your ears simply take time to adjust to having something in them that snugly for very long. I was able to go several hours and almost forget they were in. They never came loose.*The Active noice cancelling and audio sound was great. I mowed a lawn on the second day I owned them. I turned on the noise cancelling. This made the mower and string trimmer a quiet as they were when I used only earmuffs. A song started playing that I wasn't familiar with, it started out with a roller coaster and then people cheering and having fun. Since I didn't know the song, and because the audio was great I suddenly heard a whooshing sound and lots of people making noise . . . I thought something was happening and stopped the mower to look and find what all the commotion was about, only to realize it was the music. I looked around, thankfully no one saw me.*Single bud usage. I really like being able to use one earbud at a time. I was also worried if I lost one I wouldn't be able to use them at all, but either bud will work without the other.The cons:*I bought them because they were supposed to be good in noisy environments, but even at my desk I had to talk very loudly before people could hear me. This happened both on phone calls and in online meetings.*The hearthrough feature was not good. First I think they tuned the hearthrough so that the really important sounds get through. For instance, I could hear people who were near me pretty well, and I could hear most car sounds (like horns, sirens, obnoxiously loud music, etc.) as I drove. That's good, but all of the ambiance was lost. When I put them in, it sounded like I was listening through paper towel tubes. I could faintly hear the fan near me, it sounded like hiss instead of a fan. I could not hear almost anything that was more than a few feet from me unless it was really loud or one of the previously mentioned sounds. I could usually hear people who were speaking loudly, but if someone was outside my office I could only hear muffled sounds. I assume they tuned the Hearthrough for a combination of safety and battery life.The in between:*The battery life wasn't great, but I figured it wouldn't be as good as what I was replacing since they are smaller and do more. They probably had the rated runtime but with the hearthrough going the whole time I only got about 5 hours out of them. I ran them one earbud at a time unless I needed both for music, which was about 20 minutes each day.The Plantronics cost me about $50 3 years ago. I just wanted better sound and the ANC - and I got it, but it was at the cost of: battery life, call clarity, and ability to hear around me. I considered the inability to communicate effectively on calls a defect, and I sent them back.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AEIE75T4X2KIRBVMCDXKQEQHBNDA,1,4,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"August 4, 2022",2022-08-04,2022-08,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R2KPUHDKDS801W,B09D1HMBQ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, after a couple of weeks of use.",Lifesavr,4.0,"These are truly great. Their ANC for me is simply nonexistent. But I still love these. If having ANC is important for you then I would suggest another model or brand. I have a pair of stereo headphones that have amazing ANC, and they only costs $69.00. But they don't sound like these. The fact that they are selling for $100 now means it is a good time to buy.They feel good in my ears. though I am using the smallest earbuds. They seem to bother me at first after 20 minutes, but I have used these a little bit at a time, extending the time I have them in my ear, and that seems to have helped my tolerance of them. They have stayed in my ears expect for once.The app is pretty good and has most of what one will find they need. I have a little bit of trouble of getting them to connect to my different Bluetooth devices, but I feel mostly that it is just me and this will improve with my experience increases. The one thing that is really nice about these earbuds is that they are using 5.2 version of Bluetooth, which means you can connect you earbuds to two (2) different devices. Like your phone and your laptop. It makes life a lot easier.Like so many tech type items, I am sure these Jabra earbuds are on sale because Jabra is coming out with something even better to replace them. Maybe even an ANC that works. But until then, I feel for most people would be happey with these earbuds.10-19-23: I have these for a while and I have found that putting in larger ear pieces, changed everything for better sound & ANC actually works.My biggest concern is if you drop the case your ear buds will most likely fallout and you have a very good chance of losing them. Just watch it & make sure if you do drop it, open it up and make sure your buds are still safe inside. üòé","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2022",AFOGHAVPXINXIRBYWKWJO4W2VS7A,1,3,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"December 4, 2022",2022-12-04,2022-12,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R1JV4LZ8LJU3K4,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Lived up to expectations,Oliver,5.0,"Upgraded to these from 65t's, which were my first pair of wireless headphones. Of all the great options out there I chose these because I wanted to stay in the Jabra ecosystem and had a good experience with my 65t's. Was also looking for earbuds that could work independently of each other, which was not a feature of the 65t's but is with these, which I think is a necessity to avoid what happened to my 65t's where you end up with a dead battery in one earbud and a totally usable one in the other. tl;dr: they were a significant upgrade that I have very few complaints with, and if you're happy with other Jabra products or just can't decide I think it's hard to go wrong with these.Sound quality is a noticeable upgrade from the 65t's, punchy base and an excellent soundstage. Started right away with the ""hearing test"" that Jabra provides in their app so I can't speak to the sound quality without doing that but I've seen in other reviews that it can make a significant difference. Haven't used the ANC much but when I do it does the job, haven't tried other options so I don't really know what I'm missing out on but it cuts consistent ambient noise (i.e., road noise, presumably plane noises as well) pretty well. HearThrough is also much better than with the 65t's, but I find I have to crank it up to the highest setting to make a conversation intelligible, but the music still retains the same punchy quality in this mode which surprised me.Connectivity and range are on par with the 65t's, I've left my phone on the other side of an Olympic size pool while running laps and they stay connected.Haven't used the microphone much but haven't gotten any complaints, will update if the pickup quality is severely lacking but from other reviews I've seen the microphone is decent.Battery life is also a step up from the 65t's, I've charged the case maybe two or three times since I got them delivered about a month ago which is probably about for the frequency and length of my usage.I occasionally wear them in the gym and have noticed what other reviewers have referred to as the sensation that the buds are about to fall out; I've yet to have one fall out and have found that pressing them in a little deeper tends to fix the issue, but if you're a runner or other high-movement athlete perhaps these aren't the buds for you.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2023",AEKXD6T32VFRHLCCTUOAV2KP2JFA,1,7,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"July 17, 2023",2023-07-17,2023-07,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R1MWX44FJAY5MJ,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars So far so good. Make sure to use the app.,tylerite,4.0,"I think most issues reported are due to users not using the app or improperly settings the ear buds up in the app. I've only had them a week but so far I have been very impressed. I use them daily for media and conference calls. I use them with a Pixel phone.Pro- The ANC is stellar. On a plane I had no idea there were screaming kids until I took one bud out.- The battery life is some sort of magic. It's longer than any Bluetooth audio device I've owned.- integrated Alexa was a huge selling point for me and works well.- they look great. Way better than white straws hanging from your ears.- personally I love that the buttons are actually buttons and not touchCons- the hear through works ok, it's not good enough to hold a full conversation with but it will keep you aware.*- there's a weird setting for hear through on calls that let's you hear your own voice. It doesn't work great, turn it off.*- I have had issues with them not turning off when I put them back in the case and occasionally the left bud not connecting properly. Rare issues.- it seems they don't play well with laptops for video conferencing... Not sure what that's about, it's not an issue for me as I typically use both phone and laptop anyway.*These may require further app tweakingAll in all 4 stars. Would be 5 if the call quality were better and hear through were improved.

R17G2DL7BBD9CT,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars Super Comfy Fit = Good Value,Marcelo Weiss,4.0,"I am an earphone addict and love to try out different brands and different styles. Over the years, Jabra has delivered a consistent value for the money and the Elite 7 Pro did not disappoint.My favorite feature is the comfortable fit. It is a trial and error effort to find the right eargel for your shape/size of ears, but it is a must. The Jabra Sound+ app provides a good earfit test software to ensure you have a tight fit. Also, depending on your current earphone, it takes a little bit of effort to find the right insertion depth and positioning in your ear. I recommend at least one solid week of trying to feel their comfort level, do not give up on the first few days. Once they settle in, it will feel like second nature. From all the earphones I've had, this is for sure the only one I feel comfortable wearing all day long.My least favorite feature is the not-so-strong ACN (Active Noise Cancellation). Oh Jabra, if you could only make this some 30% or so better, this would be a 5-stars review. I have tried tweaking all the settings possible in the Sound+ app, but it does not get me to a level where I can tune out the sound on a medium noise level coffee shop. On a good note, you do have the ability to tune down the ANC level, which is good in certain situations where you do want more noise for safety reasons (biking for example).Battery life has not presented a problem, much for the contrary. As long as you use the charging case throughout the day, all is good for moderate to intense usage.BIG PLUS:Multipoint Connection:Yes, you can connect two devices at the same time without having to manually toggle between them. No Bluetooth setting tweaking on each device, no dropped connection, it just works! So, from laptop to phone, easy easy easy. What was annoying on other earphones, the Jabra 7 Pro makes it easy.Left & Right Button Controls:A lot of options to control through the buttons. Worth the effort to learn the one-click, two clicks, three clicks, and click-and-hold routines. And, you can program your own preferences through the app. Love it!This is a solid earphone and I recommend it for friends and family.I was rewarded for my honest recommendation of this product.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2022",AGME2C4XEKPHDDV4JCTHF7TD2EFQ,1,4,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"February 14, 2022",2022-02-14,2022-02,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
REPG7H7SFU6YW,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars Realistic Review,James Trenton Salem,4.0,"I purchased these to upgrade my 2.5-year-old 85T's and I have mixed feelings about them. The sound, it is clear and crisp and the bass is low, bumpy, and throaty. Use of the Jabra Sound app is also a nice feature. I use my earbuds everyday for everything from listening to podcasts at work at my desk or driving around, as well as exercise mostly running on an elliptical machine. For work and low movement activities, the Elite 7s are good, but the 85T's are much better for bouncy exercise. The Elite 7s have an echo that bounces the sound in your ear, whereas the 85T's stay consistent. This is annoying when trying to focus on music and breathing during an exercise. Additionally, the 85T's are much louder than the Elite 7s, but are a bit bulkier. However, the 85T's do make use of 12mm drivers and Elite 7s only use 6mm drivers. Phone calls are also better with the 85T's, anyone I talk to with my Elite 7s asks me to speak louder, so my experience shows the 85T's are more sensitive to the user's voice. Overall, I am satisfied with my Elite 7 purchase, but I am still thinking about a new set of 85T's as the Elite 7's just don't quite get it done like the 85T's. And the egg-shaped ear gummies on the 85T's seem to come out on top between the two buds' styles of round (Elite 7) vs elliptical (85T). I hope this helps anyone weighing a decision between the two.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023",AEUMBFRRUXBJ7NCX2N7MCABVLNWA,1,4,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"September 18, 2023",2023-09-18,2023-09,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I am satisfied with the product. The main downside is the buds do not fit my ear very snugly, and are prone to falling out. However, I will not blame the product for that as it is impossible for an earbud to fit all ear types, as I have small ears.The points I am most impressed with are the features included (Buttons, Jabra App, Easy connectivity, Auto Pause), and the active noise cancelling. The earbuds are very easy to use and control without having to take out your device to change settings.Other than the earbuds not fitting my ear I have 3 main gripes with the product. 1.) The charger that comes with the earbuds is way too short 2.) It is not easy to open the case for the earbuds 3.) I do not think the product is worth the full regular price of $200. As I said I got it on sale and do think I got $120 worth of earbuds, but if I spend $200 I would definitely want better sound quality and ANC.

Thankfully, the Elite 7 Pro improves battery life while still delivering excellent sound quality and noise canceling.On the DOWN SIDE...I have noticed some MAJOR connectivity issues. If you live in a world of LED lights/TVs (as many of us do), be prepared for a lot of dropped audio, disruptions, and general Bluetooth issues. I don't understand the connection between LED lights/TVs and these types of ""true-wireless"" buds, but they do not get along...and the Jabra Elite 7 Pro is the worst of the options I have at my house (Sony and Sennheiser Momentum).I have demoted these to ""ONLY GYM"" earbuds and rely on my Sennheiser for daily use...but even still, these are an excellent replacement for the 85t on battery life alone. I especially like that there is a physical button (not a touch button) on the device. This helps to prevent unintended clicks (which are a problem with my SONY and SENNHEISER). At the GYM, when my hands/biceps can be near my ears on some reps, this physical button is a major PLUS for useability.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AHCBL42QWRUIMPA2UKBJ2M3YZUPQ,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"November 6, 2023",2023-11-06,2023-11,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

R2AS171KX8MZHK,B09D1HMBQ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great product, especially for the price",Robert Willey,4.0,"These are some of the most comfortable and secure earbuds I have ever used. They sort of ""screw"" into the ear and sit tightly, which is great for outdoor sports. I can ski all day with them in and my ears don't hurt, and the sweat and water from snow hasn't impacted their performance one bit.They are also great for in the office. The pass through feature lets noise into the earbuds so if someone comes into the office I can hear them without them having to stand there until I look up and notice them. They also have a feature that stops playback of whatever you are listening to when you remove them. So if I am listening to a show in the background while I'm working, I pop them out and the show pauses. Pop them back in and we're off to the races. It is VERY handy.The noise cancellation is also great, some of the best I have used. I paid $200 for the headset I use on my PC and these earbuds match the quality 100%.My only complaints are minor. Whatever tracks whether you have your earbuds in or not is a little sensitive so the automatic pause/resume feature can hiccup sometimes. They were a little confusing at first because there is no indicator light that stays on if the earbud is out of the case, so it took a minute to figure out that my media wasn't resuming sometimes because the earbud had turned its self off while sitting on my desk. The battery life isn't QUITE what they said. I get closer to 4 or 5 hours from a full charge, but the case keeps a long charge so really I can go days without plugging the case in.UPDATE: They can be a little finnicky when connecting to a PC.

R3H9H4Z0NI0KRP,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Get or stick with the Jabra 75t/85t,Zed,3.0,"Prior to writing this review, I've been waiting for the Jabra Elite 7 Pros to come out since it was announced. I was so excited, that I had placed an order on Amazon just a couple of weeks from when they were newly announced. However, when I initially placed an order, I never received it despite it saying it was delivered. However, after contemplating whether I should order it again and since I've been seeing mixed reviews from Amazon and from YouTube reviews, I decided to order again hoping it wouldn't disappoint. I'm coming from using the Elite 75t, so I can make a comparison here for those that are contemplating whether to upgrade. Here are a few major differences I've noticed:Pros:-Much smaller than the Elite 75t-Smaller Case than the Elite 75t-Touch Buttons (as with the Elite 75t)-Slight improvement in call quality; background noise and voice clarity is improved from mic.Cons:-Case is odd/strange to open/close-Fitment is great, but I believe the 75t fits better or at least feels more snug in the ear.-Although Jabra's focus was call quality for the Elite 7 pros, I believe they could have done better. Although the mic is more improved, it really didn't do a good job suppressing wind noise when driving with the windows half way up.Conclusion:I decided to return the Elite 7 Pros simply because I believe the Elite 75t are overall better:(1) Sound - sound on the Elite 7 Pros aren't as vibrant and lacking depth as opposed to the 75t; the 75t offer much more bass; however, the Elite 7 Pros do offer a slightly better clarity, which is geared more towards acoustic music, podcast, and making phone calls.(2) Fitment: fitment seems better as it feels snug in the ear and is comfortable to wear for long periods; overall, the Elite 75t has better fitment than the Elite 7 Pros.(3) The case: the case is easier to open as opposed to the Elite 7 Pros.(4) Mic: Sure, the mic does sound better on the Elite 7 Pros than on the Elite 75t; however, it's not an awe factor since it didn't live up to my expectations.(5) Price difference - for the price difference, the Elite 7 pros aren't worth it.Verdict: I'm going to stick to my Elite 75t while I search for other alternatives to use as a back up. Because of this reason, I have decided to return the Elite 7 Pros. For those that aren't coming from the Elite 75t, I would say go ahead and invest in the Elite 75t or 85t as it is much cheaper and get more for way less.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2021",AGRVX5M3EQGJJGK5HGSU4U7MJVAQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"December 9, 2021",2021-12-09,2021-12,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

RGJNCD5IM0YGZ,B09D1HMBQ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Improved, but not perfect",Danny Underhill,4.0,"I was excited to give these a try and see how they compared to my previous Jabra experience and compare to my other every days wireless buds I have. My previous experience with Jabra was not so good. The 65T's were excellent for sound and calls, but we're so big I had to return them as they would irritate and make my ears flame red. So when the new Elite Pro 7's came out and are smaller, I was once again excited. The Elite Pro's are smaller and more comfortable for sure. I still have some slight discomfort on one side, but that I attribute to my smaller ears.The sound on the Elite Pro is good. Low, mid, and high are all very acceptable for a small wireless ear piece. This is definitely a plus.Call quality in is great, quality out seems to be touch and go. I have had a couple of calls were the person on the other end stated they had real trouble hearing me. This is a little perplexing as the Elite Pro has 4 mics compared to some other brands that only have 3 and I never have issues with outbound call quality on those.Battery life and case charges are as advertised.ANC is ok, but not great. There are better ones on the market. The fact I have to go in and set up ANC is weird. Others come out of the box ready and do a great job. Not a huge thing here, but definitely different.Storage case is a bit odd in the fact it is nearly impossible to open one handed. Where other brands have a bit of a lip to grab and open, the Elite Pro's do not have such a defined lip making one handed opening difficult.Overall these are a good set and you won't be disappointed. Some pickier folks may not be completely thrilled, but they do deliver good sound and batttery.

R3TVLDA3OWV3DE,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars I love these,Jimismycodename,4.0,"Both the left and right earbuds can work individually, or as a pair, to simultaneously connect to 2 devices in about 4-5 seconds (about as long as it takes to get them out of the case and seated in your ear). They will switch between both devices seamlessly and automatically (watching a movie on an iPad and still hear the text alerts or rings from my phone). You can use one or both earbuds; start with two and put one away, start with one and add the second - they connect/disconnect immediately and flawlessly. The app is easy to use, and allows you to program the functions of the buttons of each earbud individually. After the initial setup, there is no need to use the app again, unless you want to tweak the equalizer for a specific type of media or sound. Sound quality is fantastic, especially for sub-$100 earbuds. My only criticism is the max volume - they get loud enough, but I don‚Äôt think they are capable of getting ‚Äútoo‚Äù loud (I don‚Äôt often want/need them to get ‚Äútoo‚Äù loud, but I would like to have the option to crank it up to 11 if I so chose). Some of that has to do with the media you may be watching, but I‚Äôve just noticed that I usually run these buds between 50-70% volume, whereas other buds I‚Äôve owned were comfortably used in the 30-50% volume range. Like I said, they are loud enough for me, so it should probably only be dinged half a star (another unnecessary option I might like to have here for my rating . . . not that I need it . . . I just like options for volumes and rating systems, I guess). They‚Äôre small, light, not gaudy, nor blingy - I absolutely love them.

They are very decent airbuds with great sound and excellent noise cancellation if you listen to music or are watching a movie. However, this is why it gets such little stars. No one can hear you unless it‚Äôs absolutely quiet. Any sound around you is picked up and the people on the other end hear that and not you speaking.

Great sound while listening to music or even you listening to phone calls and conferences, however if you have to speak same deal. This goes for Beats, Bose, JBl, and sein heiser, unless you are really willing to break open piggy and get their super high end earbuds that are a down payment for a car.

R1502J59UVGVO3,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars great product good features,JG,5.0,"I have only had these Elite 7 Pro, about a week and a half. They are pretty easy to use. They are comfortable for pretty much all day wear (I do take them out and rub my ear once in a while, but never painful), and stay in place well. At least for me. I have to be active and on the move a good bit with my hands full for work while staying in touch by phone, so these Bluetooth earbuds are the ticket. I'm also pleased with the noise cancellation options which I'm often working in noisy to semi noisy environments and this cuts all that down to a very manageable level I don't believe they are actually hearing protection rated but they are certainly better then nothing in with a touch of a button your back to being able to hear and communicate with your surroundings/co-workers. I would like the option of full customization of controls which is far as I am aware is not possible there are some actions that I would like to be able to switch between right and left. I bought the Used in Good Condition level, but they arrived as far as I can tell Mint. I tend to have rather waxy ears. So far the design of the ear tips is easy to clean or does not seem easy to plug with waxy. The audio feedback is at a good volume level, and provides information without being invasive or disruptive of actual use. The multiple device pairing is a very useful feature I use all the time. I think they are a great product, I don't think I would spend full price for them, but if you can financially justify it or get them on sale, just buy them and enjoy (I have not tried any of the sister products, assume they are comparably great with their own flavors). Also I think I look like less of an idiot wearing these than those wearing Airpods, and you can put earmuffs straight over these (but may have mix results if you try taking calls with them on, I haven't tried it, and these are supposed to get -some- audio from your jaw)","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2023",AHKHXLSUGURU5I3ADPTURGIC3BTA,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"March 11, 2023",2023-03-11,2023-03,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

(Less than 80 dBs) I have friends that use apple Bluetooth noise canceling ear buds and I can hear them when they call me from the factory. I have been stubborn and refused to try any apple products. These headphones were the last attempt. I give up. Jabra has impressed me so I was convinced that this would be the one that worked for good sound in a phone call in a noisy environment.When I make a phone call the speakers mix my environmental sounds in with my phone calls. This makes it very difficult for people to hear me. On my end it is a bit annoying but I could deal with it if communication was possible.I can't return them because I don't have the box and it's probably been too long anyway. These sound great playing music but I feel like I could get the same quality from a less expensive set of buds.If anyone has a suggestion of a good noise canceling option Please let me know. Maybe I'll try again when some new products come out.I feel like these would work great if there was an option of disabling the headphone speakers in phone calls and just using my phone's microphone. The noise canceling would help my phone sound better to me and others could hear me.

The Air pods would fall out easily.I've only had these for a week so I can't talk about long term.My one nit is that although the case looks great its difficult to find an easy way to open it. Its perfectly oval and smooth. Its hard to even see which side has the hinge. You might think that the charge cord would go in the back...It does not.

R2ODRGTGAGXCYT,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars HiFi,Isaac,5.0,"Apparently these are one of the flattest frequency response headphones on the market. That means the headphones sound close to how the audio was originally produced. The sub bass, richness, body, air...it's all very balanced. I very much prefer that and even use them occasionally for professional audio work. Others may prefer headphones with more high end or more bass or less harshness, rather than these very balanced ones.The details are good for Bluetooth, and you can hear lots of nuances and small details.Stereo imaging is lacking, which is normal for in ear headphones. They sound like a lot of the music is happening inside your head. I have Dolby Atmos on my phone, laptop, and desktop, which helps make the audio more immersive and sound 3D around you, instead of inside your head. Not all devices support Dolby Atmos, and it is not provided by or officially supported by the manufacturer.ANC works well enough for me. Their app allows you to basically calibrate the active noise cancelation to your unique ears. Once I did that, most outside sounds we're reduced to levels I can ignore. Low rumbly murmer like sound still passes through, although it doesn't bother me much.I love the hear through setting. I use them to listen to music while on the road now since I can hear the road around me - they sound much better than my cars sound system.Multi device connect is a little buggy - but very convenient. I can listen to content on my laptop, then answer a call on my phone without any troubles - usually. I suspect the troubles I do have arent the headphones fault - audio device handling can be finicky in general.Latency is moderately noticable. I'd say these headphones latency is about average with other Bluetooth devices. If you're watching TV shows, the audio plays a hair after actors mouths move. I usually ignore it and stop noticing the delay. If you're wanting headphones for gaming or playing instruments on your computer, I suggest wired headphones.If I broke mine on accident, I'd buy another pair.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2023",AE7LPHMVWG3MT7HAWAKWTGSLHTRA,1,9,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"February 1, 2023",2023-02-01,2023-02,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R39FMAPJBAA2V7,B09D1HMBQ3,1.0 out of 5 stars Awful all around,Kindle Customer,1.0,"First it took almost 2 weeks for these to arrive, but that's on Amazon not Jabra.Overall these were pretty awful, I'm very disappointed after reading such glowing reviews on them. They are replacing a set of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live which without any doubt are by far the best fitting earbuds I've ever used in my life, and I've used a lot of different ones.My biggest complaint is that these make your ears/head feel very stuffy, similar to the feeling you get in an airplane when you want to pop your ears. I tried all three different size earpieces, the small were too small and they would fall out, and the medium and large made me feel stuffy. My Buds Live had an ambient mode that relieved this, although I never used it because they never felt stuffy. The closest thing on the Jabras is the pass through mode, but that's riddled with issues as I'll go into down below. No matter what I did I could not get over that feeling of discomfort, not pain, just discomfort and annoying.Sound: The sound on these is fairly mediocre, I'm really surprised that an almost $200 set of earbuds in 2023 could sound so mediocre. Highs were flat, the bass was no where as good as many of these reviews, and the soundstage was weird with a distinctive separate of instruments. With rock music I'd hear some instruments clearly only on the left, and others clearly only on the right, this isn't a soundstage, it's 2 separate stages on either side of the arena. Now maybe it was the music source (XM Radio), but listening to the same source on my Buds Live did not sound like this. Very distracting.ANC: My first question is if these really have any ANC at all. When setting them up I followed the directions to use them in a loud environment. Using the settings slider made NO difference at all in noise isolation. After they were setup, the ANC settings are weird, the slider seems to go through a set of white noise sounds, with the final one being no noise at all. This is different from the setting where you can actually add white noise to the sound. But no matter which ANC setting I put it on, phone calls always had the same white noise sound. I honestly believe 99% of the ANC on these is just the tight fit in the ear canal. I contrast these with my Buds Live which actually don't even go into the ear canal, yet still have halfway (not great) decent ANC.Just to add to the ANC debacle is how pass through mode amplifies sounds around me. My home office is in my remodeled basement next to my furnace. When pass through is on it actually greatly amplifies my furnace blowing and introduces this into the call. Actually it does this with pass through on or off, but I have to use pass through to hear my voice and in that case it amplifies it for both the person being called and myself.Reading through the reviews on here and other sites I see some of these issues are being discussed 1+ years ago and Jabra has not addressed them. That speaks to their customer service and I don't know if I want to invest in a company that doesn't address their issues.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2023",AHGEKZ2LCRH5FU6ZBVBQP76B764A,1,6,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"January 10, 2023",2023-01-10,2023-01,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

RYEMYXUTK4IBL,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Product,Elaine,5.0,"Let me start by saying, I have owned other over the ear and in-ear products and the Jabra Elite 7 Pro is a big step above the competition. The clear sound quality, advanced features, modern style, and intuitive interface really set this product out.FIRST IMPRESSION: When I first opened the packaging I was impressed with the textures and and design of the case and ear pods. Really giving them a modern feel. After first putting on the ear pods, the voice walkthrough to set the headphones up was easy and intuitive.SOUND QUALITY: Wow, this is where the Jabra Elite 7 Pro really stands out. It hits the highest highs and the lowest lows. I am used to the quality of in ear products being lower than over the ear, but that is not the case. The Bass feels very full and the treble has nice clarity. I played several different genres of music and every song allowed the sound quality to shine.USER INTERFACE: This is another aspect that stands out. I did not even have to pull out the manual to understand how to control my music. The controls are exactly what you would expect and the design is very thoughtful.STYLE AND COMFORT: When you wear the ear pods, you hardly notice them as the design is very sleek and modern. Once you fit the rubber piece correctly, I feel that you could wear these for hours without any discomfort. Jabra must have spent a long time designing these ear pods because they fit my ears perfectly.THE APP: In order to unlock the full potential of the Jabra Elite 7 Pro ear buds you really have to use the app. The developers of the app spent a long time adding numerous features that enhance sound quality, EQ, intensity of noise cancelling, and even custom fitting the ear pods to your ear.FINAL THOUGHTS: I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality in ear bud that delivers excellent sound quality on the go. You will not be let down with your purchase.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2022",AGFNIYBZ7EMW3CTBLV2E75KRRI3Q,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"March 30, 2022",2022-03-30,2022-03,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R9XK5JK2UBLYP,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones.,Devin,4.0,"These headphones are fantastic. I had a pair of Apple Pros before these and I have to say, I‚Äôm nearly as satisfied. There are some specific Apple ecosystem features you‚Äôll only get with AirPods, but you‚Äôll also being paying a premium to get. While I do miss those seldom used features, they were nice to have.However, what I don‚Äôt miss is the poor physical controls all AirPods have. These not only have excellent default controls but you can completely customize them if you prefer something else in the excellent Jabra Sound+ app. Being on a call or listening to music can have completely different controls, which is incredibly useful. Not only that, but you can tune these headphones to your preferences in said app by doing a simple hearing test or via the equalizer. Heck, you can even do both for a super personalized setup. You also get several white noise soundscapes in the app which is infinitely better than firing up a streaming service to get.The few glaring issues I have with these is that when a call is initiated or answered while they‚Äôre in my ears, I sound muffled to the person on the other side. If I take one out and reinsert it, the issue gets resolved. I cant stress enough how annoying this is. Also, when using multipoint bluetooth, there can be audio lag. Watching content can be hit or miss if you‚Äôre connected to your phone and say your pc at the same time. If I‚Äôm using them as headphones on my PC, i disconnect my phone.Overall, I‚Äôve really really enjoyed my experience with these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2022",AHTFDVHLTGV2N5BYN2YOG24PGORA,1,6,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"October 8, 2022",2022-10-08,2022-10,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

R1H0MKX3OQX2WU,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars I'm no audiophile...,Dale,4.0,"and I understand the frustrations of my fellow shoppers what with multi-point not being a thing, but these really are solid earbuds. I grabbed a few knockoffs a while back but returned them because they were just terrible. The 7 Pros have a fit and finish to them that we've come to expect, as they should with a price of $200.I will say that I'm a bit befuddled with Jabra's insistence on cannibalizing their own product line. They've got the Elite 85t, Elite 75t, Elite Active 75t, Elite 65t, Elite Active 65t, Elite Sport, Elite 7 Pro, Elite 7 Active, and the Elite 3. I don't understand why they have so many different CURRENT versions. I can understand if they're older products being phased out, but to continue selling each at retail value, to say nothing of the manufacturing efforts seems foolish. As a consumer I had to spend an hour comparing all the different versions. Some have a better IP rating than others, some have 3 vs 4 microphones etc. Some vary in battery life by an hour, some are rated with their case's battery life. It's confusing to say the least.Regardless, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. Maybe one day they'll consolidate their lineup to 3-4 options for different consumer profiles. Until then, these will do.BTW, I've now done 3 firmware updates since I've owned these, and it's never been a problem. Just put them in the case, close the case and let the update finish. Let the light on the front stop blinking purple and you should be good. I hear multi-point is coming, but until then note that you CAN pair these to multiple sources‚Äîyou'll just need to disconnect them from the source they're connected to before connecting them to a new source.

R3HDDJNWBDZVIM,B09D1HMBQ3,2.0 out of 5 stars The most annoying $200 I've ever spent,Benbalam,2.0,"When these things actually charge you can get about 4 hours of battery life with these if you turn off noise cancellation and hear-through modes.The last hour of their battery life though you will constantly hear each earphone individually crying ""recharge battery"" independently at different time periods. They can last like this for a whole hour before they decide to actually die. It is beyond annoying, you can't configure them to not make a noise, and an hour of it is just excessive. Either stop telling me or turn off please.Then when it comes time to charge sometimes they just will not charge in the case even when the case has a full battery and the lights on the earphones blink when you put them in the case. I lay the whole thing on the counter and let them charge and a 1/3 of the time when I go to pick them up again they are only 30% charged, which lets them last like an hour but you will hear the extremely annoying ""recharge battery"" sound the whole time which is unbelievably annoying.The noise cancellation and hear through modes don't deal with metallic noises very well. If you work with metal at all these things will put out a very high pitched extremely loud noise whether they're trying to cancel the metal on metal sound or pass it through. really makes them worthless for those kinds of jobs.There is also a wind noise that gets passed through these too if you're moving at speed with these in. I mow my lawn with them in and if there's any wind outside I'll hear the wind noise through the earphones regardless of what mode I'm inThis is probably the worst $200 I've ever spent on electronics.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AGWHUIXSIKEBUDULHA5DEOFIQQ4Q,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"March 12, 2024",2024-03-12,2024-03,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R1KOCA7JY9CZ83,B09D1HMBQ3,"3.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect on paper, very disappointed in reality",Win,3.0,"1. Just to clarify, my review is about the 7 Pro. I don't know why but Amazon seems to put all Jabra's reviews together here. I've read quite a few before realizing that those were reviews for 75/85t.2. Like I said, the 7 Pro seems like the perfect pair I've been waiting for. ANC, transparency mode, single mode, multipoint, 6 mics with bone conductor, etc. Added those to great sound and sleek design, the 7 Pro is clearly the winner. Unfortunately, it doesn't.3. Let's start with ANC, well, what ANC? I have quite a few ANC tws but the Jabra Elite 7 Pro is one of the weakest ANC I've experienced with. I couldn't tell the difference between ANC on or off. Transparency mode, on the other hand, is excellent. I've been using Jabra tws since 65t and the transparency on their earbuds are always the best.4. Call quality, this is another area that 7 Pro failed me. I bought this earbud because I trust Jabra when it comes to call quality. To my surprise, everybody told me either I sounded like I was under water, driving with top down, walking outside in the wind, etc. Some people just told me they couldn't hear me at all. The weird thing was it only happened to the left earbud. When I used just the right, everyone can hear me just fine. At first, I thought it was a defect so I sent it back. Got another replacement and still have the same problem. The worst thing was when I used both earbuds, the call quality was still bad on the other end. To the point that I had to put the left bud back in the case, resume the call and people can hear me just fine.5. Everything else about the Elite 7 Pro was perfect as they said. Just the ANC and call quality on the left side that I couldn't use these buds as my daily driver. What a shame!","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2022",AGOA6VPNL3A4APRLVEK2AV2RZ6HQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"April 4, 2022",2022-04-04,2022-04,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R26OVIH0PWGKPP,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Somewhat disappointing,Brian Douglas,3.0,"The design of these earbuds are such that most of the mass of the bud itself is above the ear canal which, at least for me, means that as you move around they work their way out and if you don't re-seat them (about every 10 minutes) they'll fall out. It's fine if you're sitting in front of your computer but not at all useful if you're being active. The only way I found to combat this was to use the smallest silicon ear piece and seat them so far in my ear it was painful - also not helpful.I've seen reviews that rate the call experience with these earbuds really highly - especially in noisy environments. The sound app that comes with them even allows you to adjust the side tone which I was excited about. Sadly, none of it went very well. I could only get them to successfully work with my iPhone about half the time - mostly due to the mic. Often I could hear the other person but the mic didn't transmit on my end. I adjusted just about every setting in the sound app and even flashed the firmware - twice. I tried several times to get them to work with zoom too, but ended up throwing in the towel.The battery life and sound quality are very good however, so I'd say that if you're wanting to mostly sit still and get a lot of battery life out of your earbuds while not answering the phone, these are a decent choice. For me, I'll go back to the AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AH64ZUAMVFS6FN2AMO2SLBB5FHHQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"February 22, 2023",2023-02-22,2023-02,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I was impressed.However, the earbuds seem to work independently, while this could be a good thing, they don't communicate with one another properly. When I updated the firmware, the left earbud immediately stopped working. I followed the instructions and waited for the purple light on the case to stop blinking, and actually gave it additional time.The solution? I had to reset, repair, mess with buttons on each earbud, over 10 times before finally stumbling across a reddit article that said to take the 1 earbud out not working, put it in pairing mode, (hold for 3 seconds), and switch languages in the app. (I didn't have to do that, the app immediately recognized the left didn't have the firmware, but it took over an hour to get it working, unacceptable.The ANC and sound quality are not really that good in my opinion, and I'm far from an audio snob. It seems to just draw in white noise more than actually cancel out sounds.The drivers are tiny, 6mm, and while the music is acceptable, it's not good.The fit was comfortable, but for me, they seem to lock in too much pressure....resulting in my hearing my blood, pulse, and lots of just generally irritating sounds unless music is playing.Sadly I never got to test the call quality, I received them 10/17 at 2pm and have a return label printed at 8pm.To be fair, I think the company is probably a good one, the build quality, instructions seem very compassionate and thought out, but this isn't what I personally am looking for.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2022",AET5A3OMOIBMBDCOYAQEXMNPEHIA,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"October 18, 2022",2022-10-18,2022-10,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

RF7U3I25INRET,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Improvement from 75t active,Breanna,5.0,"Having the Jabra Elite Active 75t previously, the Jabra Elite 7 pro stood out in a couple of ways.The run time was boosted from almost 4 hours to nearly 8 hours. When you include that both earbuds are available in mono-mode, you can get close to 16 hours out of these on a single charge. The claim of 15 min charging leading to 1 hour of playback is pretty accurate, but I did notice the case charge only lasted for one full recharge. The 75t's had at least two total charges for me. I didn't mind it when you include the mono-mode giving 8 hours on each bud. I just had to charge it on my drive home.The sound was also markedly improved between the two. I'll never claim to be an audiophile, but these are great when you need good music or podcasts during the workday. Call quality was the same between the two. I didn't make many calls, so I don't know the drain on the battery.A couple of other things to note:I used the mono-mode far more frequently because my work requires it, but while playing with ANC mode, there was no big difference compared with the 75t. Still pretty good, though, it'll quiet the din out of any room.The case feels bigger than the 75t. It still fits easily in the pocket, but accidentally opening it while pulling the case out is thankfully fixed.While Jabra claimed a better ear fit, I didn't experience it. It was the same for me, but I didn't have a big problem with the fit of the 75t. It'll fit for regular day wear, but 'hard activity' like running tends to fall out and require some readjusting.In general, this is an excellent option if you work in an office environment and would like some sound upgrade and would like to charge less.

I've now personally owned 3-4 other top of the line products and I can say with confidence I think these are the most well rounded.First off - Music and Sound Quality:These headphones along with being paired with their app give the user a very high quality, and fully customizable experience. Some people want to up the bass - these headphones have the deepness. Others want to hear more of the highs - you're covered there too with the customization. I personally think this is one of my favorite features. Movies, podcasts, and music all sound as they're supposed to without being too bass heavy, voice heavy, or lacking rich mediums.Call Quality - something that Jabra really focuses on with these headphones is the call quality and the technology built into the microphones. I personally don't see this as the strongest point of the headphones. Call quality is very good, and does exactly as you'd expect - however I wouldn't say it tops any charts in that department.Battery life - fantastic battery life and lives up to it's advertised amount of 35+ hours including the case.Active Noise Cancelling - Works very well with hear through. Something I know many people deal with including myself is that when we listen to active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones - it can almost cause pressure headaches as it feels like you're underwater or something. These are the first and only ANC headphones I've ever used where I truly can say I don't experience this at all.Overall these headphones are now my new favorite and I'll be recommending them to all friends and family.

R3S2IHTRL48NFZ,B09D1HMBQ3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Got it for the mic quality, for calls",Metalcastr,5.0,"I did a lot of research before getting these. Nearly all bluetooth earbuds have one inherent weakness that I wanted to overcome, and that's mic quality. Most earbuds have awful mic quality, and sound like a muffled mess that's hard to understand. But not these! I was also looking for a neutral sound profile with ""good"" audio quality, something I consider primarily good for calls, and then for general listening. Note that ""good"" is subjective, as everyone's preferred audio profile will be different, such as liking more of bass, treble, midtone, etc.Within the category of current generation 2022-2023 bluetooth earbuds, the mic on these is good, one of the best. If we compare it to another device category, such as USB microphones for PCs, then it's not great, but there are no great built-in microphones for bluetooth earbuds, it's just not available. So it's a comparison in the category in which it can compete, the bluetooth earbud category.Doing research online, and listening to mic sound samples on the Rtings website, these have some of the best mic quality for earbuds, they sound fuller than others, while not being too quiet or muffled. Comparing to a lot of other mics that don't pick up certain frequencies, that make voices sound hollow or ""tinny"", and hard to understand. I did not want to be the person hard to understand, so I got these.There are currently a few (and only a few) other bluetooth earbud sets on the market with good mic quality, do some research to see which ones have a good audio profile for you, both in the mic, and for general listening.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2023",AELZE5RZLUL3647TNML3GPNCPMNA,1,7,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"March 8, 2023",2023-03-08,2023-03,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R12XY6GUQ9K0JH,B09D1HMBQ3,4.0 out of 5 stars very good headphones,Chris,4.0,This is the first time I have spent more than $30 for earbuds and I am not disappointed. Great sound quality. The button controls are fantastic. The ANC isn't quite as good as I hoped but very noticeable and I am still pleased. Purchased in hopes that these would be capable earbuds for phone calls while I walk the neighborhood. Sound-wise they are great but the mic seems to only last for about 5 minutes before getting too soft/cutting out and other person cannot hear me well. Very nice fit in ear.

R1UOE5S6SWDVL4,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Good for Most,Authorized Reviewer,3.0,Unboxing Experience is first. Keep in mind that I was provided this product t at a discount for my honest review. With that¬†being said I don't think what I got was the retail box. Grey box with no artwork or showcasing the brand. Once you dive inside its everything you expect. The headphones look beautiful and feel hefty in a good way. You also get ear cups for all sizes as well as a charging cable that will leave you wanting. You do have wireless charging with this pair so if you have one with your phones it will be a nice edition. Next is performance. Setting up with the proper app gives you plenty of control which is good because out of the box my units were high in the treble. Now everyone has their own opinion here but I feel this is where they were lacking. All the songs I use for testing just felt like they were missing something. The sound wasn't too low but no matter what I did there was never the right amount of bass. As for the noise cancelation they were there but in my testing not that effective. The one thing that was a cool factor but in reality a sore point on these headphones was the microphone. Using technology to use the vibration in your bones to help ended up coming up as poor audio experience for my callers on the other side. Lastly I have previous versions of these headphones and absolutely love them. These headphones were a miss and potentially not meant for me. They may be right for you which is why I rate them a 3/5. Most will buy these and love them and I do recommend them for the majority.,"Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2022",AHLJ2J3IYUKICHTMUMYY4IFFZAUQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"May 4, 2022",2022-05-04,2022-05,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R6L7RBC0COSS8,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Good replacement for my Elite 75t,Michael D,5.0,"I lost my Elite 75T earbuds, and they've been discontinued. I almost pulled the trigger on the Elite 85T, but reading at the Jabra site that the earpiece doesn't go as far into the ear made me reconsider. After receiving the Elite 7 Pro's, I am very happy with the earbuds.What I am not happy about is the case. They changed it to be shorter and fatter. That in and of itself is not the concern though. With the old taller and skinnier case, I could open the top just by pushing the top towards the back, and it would open.With the short and fat design on the new case, it will not open like that, and they did not put any little tabs on the case in order to pry the top open, so I have to use a fingernail in order to open it.While this may not seem like a big deal, if the case is in my pocket when the phone rings, I do fumble in getting the earbud into my ear in time to answer, because it takes a little longer than before to open the case. Additionally, with no tabs it's difficult to know which side opens without looking at it which is not handy when driving.I am going to try and make some tiny tabs on the front using a tiny bit of Bondic which if it works, will help with not only lifting the top, but also in being able to open the case without looking at it.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2023",AEIAE2IZG6VR4OQNFOBDIXCI4HNA,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"July 19, 2023",2023-07-19,2023-07,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R2F775QXLRH0PQ,B09D1HMBQ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, nice form factor, mediocre noise cancellation",MaplewoodGeek,4.0,"I have owned dozens of different ear buds, so I have a lot to compare these with.The sound is very good (for bluetooth, in-ear buds). The small size and weight helps keep them from falling out as easily as most other true wireless ear buds.There are really two areas that I am disappointed with these buds.The first is the lack of multi-point pairing. They can only connect to one device at a time. I have them paired with my phone, tablet, and laptop. They will automatically reconnect to the most recent device. To connect to a different device, I go into the bluetooth settings of the connected device and disconnect them. Then I click connect from the other device. I don't have to re-pair every time, but there are still extra steps. Jabra has promised to provide this feature in a future firmware update, but so far they had not done it.The second thing that disappoints me is the noise cancellation. With a good seal the ear buds provide decent passive noise cancellation. The active noise cancellation barely has any effect. While on a plane in flight I toggled the noise cancellation on and off and it made almost no difference. Maybe this will improve with future firmware updates.These are still my preferred ear buds, but if noise cancellation and multi-point pairing is important to you, look at something else or wait until these issues are fixed via firmware.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2022",AG7YI6AVRCXSHVLMRASJHJT723GQ,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"January 7, 2022",2022-01-07,2022-01,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

Have to say I Really like the 7 pro - it takes care of any deficiencies of the 75t model - mainly that you can use Either ear bud one at a time (love this as my hearing is better in my right ear - so when I‚Äôm monitoring meeting in background it‚Äôs nice to have just the left earbud in so I can still hear if someone asks me a question etc)Plus it‚Äôs just Awesome that you can have it synced to Multiple devices - I currently have it synced with my iPhone and laptop - and it‚Äôs smart about auto switching as needed.At first my only gripe was the case is a Little larger - and it‚Äôs a little harder to Open one handed - but after using it for awhile I don‚Äôt notice the larger size in my pocket - also I actually Like that it‚Äôs a little harder to open the case as it keeps the buds secure - in past sometimes the case opened Too easy and bud would fall out etc. One thing worried me is the case is so Smooth and slick easy to slip out of hands - so I actually Buffed the case to make it a little harder surface and easier to keep in hands securelyBut in any case - also the audio quality has really improvedThis is just a great setupI‚Äôm even purchasing a second one at the great deal pricing going on for a friend,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2022",AED42CNR2V4HG4YAEKDG7HVORD4A,1,3,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"December 6, 2022",2022-12-06,2022-12,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R244D6LS75F6IE,B09D1HMBQ3,3.0 out of 5 stars OK after January firmware update,B. Rogers,3.0,"On day 2 and also day 12 of ownership, I had the right earbud stop working (all it would do is click at me when I held the button down) until I followed a factory reset procedure. After the reset, you have to re-do the pairing on each device that you use. So that's annoying.ANC is nonexistent. There is an ANC mode, but it just generates a very tiny bit of extra noise and cancels nothing compared to having ANC off.I did the firmware update on day 1, so these issues exist with the latest firmware at the time of me writing this review (1.5.0 released Dec 2, 2021). There's supposed to be a January update that adds multipoint, and I hope that also fixes these problems, but we're getting to the end of January and it hasn't happened yet. I'll update this review if a firmware update comes out soon enough for me to test and become confident in before my return window closes, otherwise this product is getting returned.Update: The 2.0 firmware came out the morning after I wrote this. I have it installed and multipoint is working well so far. There is no noticeable change to ANC. Stability could be better, but it's too early to be sure. I'll update this review in a week or so and increase the rating if there are no problems.Update: Working much better on 2.0, and I have found some conditions under which ANC does something. There's a certain background noise level you have to reach before ANC will make any difference. There are still some glitches, but they are not all the time anymore. I'm hoping for another update to improve it further.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2022",AEEL3GYA3OPNEJJZGC6GL6V5CSXA,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"January 27, 2022",2022-01-27,2022-01,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R10LGMJV8RWGYK,B09D1HMBQ3,"3.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Quality, But the Firmware Isn't There",Fredrik Deboer,3.0,"I got these to replace 75ts, and I have the same reaction: very strong audio quality, good noise cancelation, great battery life, superb physical construction, but repeated issues with connectivity are a major letdown. They sound quite good, even for someone who's into hifi equipment, call quality is not a problem for me at all (contra some other reviewers), and they feel so premium. But I have had several tear-my-hair-out frustrations with getting the earbuds to connect. Several times, I have suddenly lost connection to one earbud. This has seemingly happened in response to changing from one app to another (such as from my music app to YouTube), but it's hard to understand why that would affect a Bluetooth connection. The right earbud will work, but the left won't. Common fixes like turning on and off Bluetooth, unpairing the earbuds, and putting them into their case have no effect. The truly aggravating thing is that many of the troubleshooting suggestions I see involve pressing both buttons on the earbuds - but the left earbud is not connected, so it doesn't work! Each time I've eventually restored connection, but always just by messing around for ages and then finding they suddenly work again, so I don't have an effective workaround. It's quite frustrating, and given that I have similar problems with the 75ts I suspect that I didn't just get unlucky.It's a shame too because this is a very high-quality product with great sound for the price, and we badly need good alternatives to the Apples and Samsungs of the world. You might get these and never encounter the problems I have, in which case I think you're in for a treat. For me, I just hope I don't get another unlucky disconnect issue again.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AEULQRM674YAQVIH5WILJMYIRIEQ,1,8,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"December 10, 2021",2021-12-10,2021-12,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R5AU5A8IR6ZJE,B09D1HMBQ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Jabra Elite 7 Pro Checks All the Boxes,NYY,5.0,"Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I have always been anxious to try a set of Jabra earbuds, which have been included on every top ten list of best true wireless Bluetooth earbuds for as long as I can remember. The relatively new Jabra Elite 7 Pro appears to share flagship status and price point with the earlier Jabra 85T, but seems to offer several advantages, notably a smaller size and lighter weight, better water and sweat resistance, longer earbud and battery case battery life, and upgraded Bluetooth to version 5.2.I have to say that, among the earbuds that I have tried thus far, at various price levels, the Jabra Elite 7 Pro are quite comfortable over long periods and, more importantly, I have less fear of them falling out with head movement due to their light weight and tight fit. Moreover, the sound and call quality are excellent and the active noise cancellation (ANC) is quite good, no doubt helped along by the close fit of the earbud and the ANC control offered by the Sound+ app provided by Jabra. A single tap of the left earbud enables the HearThrough function to disable ANC for conversation, also controllable through the app. The factory EQ tuning is set for more natural sound reproduction but can be customized in the app if you want or need more bass.Battery life, especially with ANC on lives up to the specified 8 hours, with rapid recharge available for quick extension of the listening session. The inclusion of Alexa and Google Assistant as well as mono mode and multipoint connection are added pluses, along with the compact case.All in all, the Jabra Elite 7 Pro checks all the boxes for a high end, albeit somewhat expensive, Bluetooth earbud and I would strongly recommend consideration for purchase.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2022",AHSOX7XNCAIWS26TZTLDLVGHXG7A,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"March 16, 2022",2022-03-16,2022-03,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I have a bit of trouble getting the bud to get a perfect seal. I can live with it though.

I wish Jabra would make them with a ‚Äúrubberized ‚Äú finish on the case and the buds.. they are slick so it makes it a pain to open the case and get a grip on the buds. My solution is to moisten a tissue and rub it on my fingers until almost dry and I can open the case with ease and insert them into my ears and adjust until I get a good fit. Clean ears are a must. In the app there is a test that tells you if you have a great fit which is cool. It also has a hearing test similar to the ones that a doctor does to determine your hearing range.

Ear bud fit is always a problem for me, and I've found most of the small wireless earbuds will not stay in my ears, especially if I'm the least but active. These earbuds slide in smoothly and stay put! Jabra offers 3 different sizes of ear fittings, and the mediums that come with it fit perfectly for me.The setup of the earbuds is very straightforward, download the Sound+ app and walk through the steps. The app will show you how to use and customize the different tap settings, and also run any needed software updates. Very intuitive and a nice introduction as you get started using the new earbuds. There is also a ""Find my Jabra"" setting that will use location tracking to keep track of the location. Neat feature if this ever does fall out of your ears!Now that we've discussed the fit and setup, let's get to the sound. The sound quality of these is amazing. They have the option to enable noise cancelling, and to easily disable it by tapping the left earbud in cases where you want to hear outside of the earbuds. The sound is also very clear even when using one ear bud, which I often do because I'm multi-tasking. The app has preset equalizers or you can customize your own.I'd highly recommend the Jabra Elite Pro Ear buds as a great alternative to other higher priced wireless earbuds and I'm very happy I've found them as they have greatly enhanced my music listening experience!

However, the included ear tips aren't well designed and can bite into the ears over long periods of time. Instead of being gently curved back, the tips have a sharp rubber edge that can create a painful groove in the ear.This is an EASY FIX. You can find replacement ear tips for this model as low as $4.50. DON'T get generic replacements as these buds have an unusually small tube for the ear tips and generics will likely fall off. As long as you order model specific ear tips with this you won't have any problems.NOTE: These are practically identical to the Jabra Elite 7 Active in terms of hardware, order whichever is cheaper/on sale. Also the Elite 7 Actives won't stay in better because the rubber portion is on the outside of the bud, not the part that actually touches your ear.

But the little things that I didn't realize mattered have kept me from giving it a 5 start review. First off, and I know it may seem like nitpicking, the charging case doesn't have a groove for opening it. You might thing ""who cares?"" But I can tell you, when you're sweaty from a workout, or trying to handle the case with one hand, it's almost impossible to open it. With how frequently the ear buds are in their case, this starts to add up to an inconvenience. I've also noticed that in a day full of meetings, the connectivity is hit or miss with my Mac. Sometimes, I have no issues, but other times the ear buds seem to cycle between trying to enable the microphone and listening, which causes neither to work.Overall, the connectivity issues and the case build definitely make this a bit of a downgrade from the Jabra 75t's.

LOLThey can pair to two devices at once so I can be listening to my TV and paired with my phone if a call came, but also I can use the Jabra Sound+ app to adjust the sound without having to switch devices!I've still got a huge learning curve or figuring out if there's anything else I can do because there are different levels of hearing through so I can hear more from outside the earbuds, but it appears to be only so I can hear myself better when on the phone, but why can't it adjust when I have to talk to someone Next-To-Me so that I can hear what's going on and not have to take them off!?Also, they have a much smaller profile than the earlier models so they are very sleek, super comfortable and extremely useful...

Jabra has updated the software, and my one big complaint had gone away. The sound on these buds fantastic, and people I speak with on the phone say the microphone quality is fantastic. Also, the problems I used to have came mostly after connecting with a PC, and these buds are designed for mobile. If you want buds to switch from PC to mobile, I‚Äôd recommend the Evolve2 buds, which are specifically designed for that.Former review:My ratings for these have ranged from two to five stars. I first gave them two stars because the software failed when switching from stereo to mono and back. An update seemed to have fixed that, so I increased the rating to five stars. Then one crashed again, and I couldn‚Äôt reset it. After about 12 hours and a lot of weirdness, it started working again.An online search showed me that lots of people have had problems with the earbuds switching to single-side mono and then the other one not working again. This is a serious glitch that drops these down to three stars, and even that‚Äôs generous. The sound is so good when they work that I‚Äôm not dropping it lower.Jabra will probably eventually fix this issue with a software update. But maybe not. Until then, I recommend their 75t active, which has almost as good sound but no glitches.‚Äî-Previous positive review:I‚Äôm not an audiophile, but these sound as good as the other five-star rankings say.

R2JEY2TXF6GY0C,B09D1HMBQ3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Constantly disconnects, no user manual",Michael,2.0,"So let me just start off by saying that I paid for NEW earbuds, and I'm starting to wonder if what I was given were actually refurbished. There wasn't even a user manual included. I pulled the whole package apart searching for ANY kind of setup instructions and there were none, there was not a single piece of paper in the box. After finally getting them to sync up with my devices, I have to say that the sound quality and battery life were decent... That said, good sound quality and battery life do not make up for the headache these things have caused me on a daily basis for the past several weeks. They will constantly disconnect at random intervals for seemingly no reason, and when I do finally manage to get them to reconnect after fighting with them for ten minutes, only ONE earbud (the left one) will actually turn back on, no matter how many times I reset them OR my laptop. I had to stop trying to use them with my phone altogether because they simply wouldn't connect most of the time, sometimes they wouldn't even show up in the list of devices and on the off chance I DID get them to sync up, it was like pulling teeth to get them to sync back up to my laptop afterward, even after I removed them from my phone entirely. Overall, not worth the headache. I was lead to believe these were much better quality but I'm guessing all those reviews were written by people who only used them for a couple days at most because it's been nothing but a hassle since I got them. Even my cheapest ear buds sync up faster and easier than these do. I am not willing to tear my hair out over this just for a couple extra hours of battery life.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AFSCZM677QYXPZU4N3Z2UG2O6IEA,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"July 15, 2023",2023-07-15,2023-07,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I use them running, trail running, and bicycling. They've stood up well. I have replaced the earbud tips with comply foam. Two things you should be aware of. With the Comply foam tips, this has almost completely removed the need or benefit of the ANC as i can hear no difference in blocked sounds with the Comply tips. Also, the sound design seems to emphasize mid range. The sound is just not terribly full. The upside to this is that if you are an audiobook listener, you will absolutely love these IEM's. Oh, and just to be clear, I do feel the comply foam tips have actually improved the bass from the stock tips. They do stay quite secure. I've never had them work themselves out and with the Comply's, I've never had to adjust them during a run. When on the road, I use the 'hear through' which works quite well, and when off road, i just leave the ANC/Hear through off which does increase the battery time.Enjoy.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2022",AFVJZ5TFZFVKNCTJO6L5WOVPF6JQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"June 13, 2022",2022-06-13,2022-06,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
RLACHMSTFRN6D,B09D1HMBQ3,2.0 out of 5 stars Good but not worth the price if you need the microphone,J Hancock,2.0,"I bought these as an upgrade for a much cheaper ($49) set that I use for work and music. First impression was good, they fit well and the battery life was great and it solved my to biggest issues with my others and the sound is amazing but that's where it went downhill for me. These earbuds introduced 3 new issues that I've never had with my cheaper ones. 1st, the microphone is unusable for work calls as you some distant and in a barrel. I know I can't expect perfect quality from earbuds but these are horrible compared to my others. 2nd is the multipoint switching. I like to have my buds on my laptop as primary and phone secondary so that I can listen to music between calls and when I start a video call the audio automatically switches to my laptop. With these buds even trying the instructions to connect my laptop first My phone always overtakes the connection. There have been several times in the middle of a video conference call that my microphone and sound completely cuts out because of a notification on my phone. 3rd is the latency of the sound for video. Both on conference calls and watching videos and clips on my phone the picture is always out of sync.For troubleshooting I have installed and re-paired to my devices multiple times and changed multiple settings and I can't overcome these issues. After looking at multiple online forums it seems to be firmware issues so I re-loaded the firmware by changing the voice assistant language but that didn't help either.Bottom line, if you want them for music only I recommend but if you need to use the microphone I would say pass. I've just ordered another brand to test and will be returning these since earbuds this expensive shouldn't come with these problems and I shouldn't need to jump through hoops to get them to work.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2023",AENGCLFIAUYZABYUU3AREKBDB7TQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"February 25, 2023",2023-02-25,2023-02,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

The passive noise canceling (because of the tight fit) is outstanding. Speaking of fit, these are hands down the most comfortable ear buds I have ever used. They are light and fit perfectly. I have used them for working out (and I sweat...a lot) and they never moved and stayed very comfortable....

R2RTT8B6JXWOX6,B09D1HMBQ3,2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound. Good ANC. Terrible audio sync when watching videos.,MrrQuackers,2.0,"Firstly, they sound fantastic, great sound all around and the app does a really neat set up feature where it uses your specific ear to adjust the EQ. It uses buttons instead of touch sensors which isn't too bad since the button are nice and easy to press (so you're not jamming the bud in your ear when trying to press). They do not offer high fidelity like LDAC, heads up there if you're looking for superior audio codecs.The absolute worst part and the reason I returned these for much better earbuds was the audio sync issue when watching videos. Whether you're using the multipoint feature or not, if you try to watch any video on your Windows computer (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) the audio will fall out of sync and get worse the longer your watch. The only way to fix it would be to pause or back up the video over and over until it was back in sync (only for it to go out of sync the longer watched, rinse and repeat).The kicker was when I contacted Jabra they offered no solutions and simply said that they DO NOT test their products with computers. When I pressed on the issue and stated the multipoint feature. They claimed this was meant for someone who has a work phone and personal phone, or a phone and a tablet. When they said thet I responded that their own marketing video showing off multipoint where it shows a woman using the feature with a Windows Surface Laptop and her phone. After that they shifted the goal post and just stated that it may work but it is not supported.After this I returned these earbuds due to the terrible audio sync issue and the absolute worst support from Jabra. I ended up getting the Technics EAH-AZ60 and have never been happier. They do everything the Jabra's do plus offer LDAC and no audio sync issues. They also have touch sensitive controls that works great (no buttons).","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2022",AHJPMG2QHUTUJC4AQOSSWQQVR24Q,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"October 27, 2022",2022-10-27,2022-10,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

Sometimes one starts playing a second before the other. When the active or pro are wet they still work fine, but the mic is muffled for a phone call until they dry. Of the 3, I think the active is the the most comfortable. You wouldn't think that little rubberized part would make that much difference but it does with long hours of use. The noise canceling is okay, but not great and for that reason I think the 3 is the best value unless you need it to be water resistant or want the ""okay"" noise canceling. Overall I think they are all good. I have NOT had anyone ask me if I was on bluetooth or say they couldn't hear me on any of them (except when wet). I gave the 3 to my son and alternate the other 2 throughout the day when the batteries die. (Side note the 3 doesn't use voice ""2 devices connected"" ""pairing"" for example). The last feature I like is the ""battery low"" warning is about an hour before the battery is dead on the 7's. I'm not sure on the 3.I also wanted to add that the 7's can connect with 2 devices at a time.

At 1st I was very skeptical because the packaging of this product was very bland and simple.. My current earbuds came in a more flamboyant packaging and went packaging and the lot was able to stand out as well as I kept the packaging whereas these these I had no desire to keep the box. Once I did try them though I was very surprised. They adapted easily to my cell phone, they have just as good a range, and the sound quality even when adjusting my equalizer was very comparable to my current earbuds.. I made some phone calls and listen to some videos as well to fully test them out and I can say I didn't see much difference compared to my current model.. Other than the shape of the ear piece compared to the Bose, these are very high quality without the higher price of my current Bose. I did have to change out the ear piece so they would fit a little more comfortably but they seem to stay in place just fine. The one thing that is lacking lacking is that my current earbuds haven't earbuds have an extra attachment so so when in place they do not jar loose nearly as easily.

R2R785A4G4ABHP,B09D1HMBQ3,2.0 out of 5 stars The Elite 7 Pro not impressive,Jaxly,2.0,"Coming from Jabra elite 75t, which has a very flat and narrow sound, the elite 7 pro is a nice upgrade. I needed mid-level earbuds with multiple points connection, so I bought the elite 7 pro. It took 20 min to update and install the newest firmware with the expectation for top-level sound quality and mid-level ANC. The fact is that the 7 pro earbuds are nowhere near the expectation.With some fancy features like comfortable to wear, multipoint connection, in-ear detection, and sound profile personalization, the 7 pro earbuds are very friendly to use. However, the sound quality and ANC are very disappointing.The sound quality of 7 pro earbuds is simply not comparable to the Bose qc earbuds, and it is not even as good as the 40 bucks Fiil T1XS. The EQed T1XS has way richer, punchier, more dynamic, and more layered sound than the 7 pro earbuds. The sound of the 7 pro is very light and soft even after tweaking with all the EQ settings. To have a better idea about the sound quality of T1XS, it is slightly less clear than the apple airpods, which is not known for its sound quality.If you want TWS earbuds with at least mid-level ANC, skip the 7 pro. The ANC of the 7 pro is strange. It's like changing the natural environmental noise to a hybrid of artificial and natural noises. It reduces the environmental noise a little bit, but it doesn't go silent at all.For this 160 to 200 USD price range, you may expect at least the above-average sound quality or ANC. Unfortunately, the Jabra elite 7 pro does not meet either criterion. I would rather go to more expensive Technics AZ60, the Sennheiser MTW3, or Sony 1000xm4 with the highly-rated sound quality and mid to top ANC, than pay for this already high price for earbuds with nothing. I wouldn't recommend Bose qc earbuds unless the bulky case, kind short battery life, slow connection, and dependent left earbud are not issues to you. If you need half in-ear tws earbuds with the best ANC and top sound quality, the qc earbuds are still the best choise.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2022",AHHKV5GPVMCFTIB3UUPV7WJACWHA,1,2,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"June 4, 2022",2022-06-04,2022-06,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I recommend downloading the app before inserting them into your ears. They immediately walk you through the pairing and set up process.

The hear through technology is extremely helpful while walking around in the city, giving you the ability to be aware of your surroundings (for safety).The fit of these earphones out of the box was good, but I prefer a tighter fit so the larger earpieces helped my fit. They also enhanced the ANC performance by reducing the surrounding noise even further. Calls are easily answered with the one press f the right or left earpiece. All the functions are easily adjusted to your liking through the easy to use Jabra Sound+ app. you can adjust just about everything imaginable through the app. The sound is incredible in these. From the high notes and the deep bass boost that is available, you will find the setting that best fits your listening preferences or you can use the preset options that the app offers.Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase and will enjoy using the Jabra Elite 7 Pro in the future. #JabraElite7Insiders","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2022",AH4UMSR6BFKBQ77G3UM2DXVBFX7A,1,1,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"February 11, 2022",2022-02-11,2022-02,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

As soon as I put the buds in they start telling me the battery is low, but it is apparently just a glitch as it will stop telling me that after a bit and keep working for a random amount of time, then they just die. it could be 30 minutes or three hours.They also just started disconnecting randomly after a while and they seem to confuse Spotify for some reason at times and just keep pausing it over and over making it impossible to listen.Good product out of the box, but seriously flawed. I don't understand how they just keep making them like this.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2023",AHEB3O7RBHG5VSGU66N5FP6XDQQQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"September 13, 2023",2023-09-13,2023-09,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

R5RGIP0ZL7BG5,B09D1HMBQ3,1.0 out of 5 stars DON'T BUY these. Unreliable. Frequently drops BT connections. Google Assistant integration is 50/50.,LvgZombie,1.0,"See the headline. I don't recommend these. Although the sound performance (including ANC) is excellent when the buds are working ... they are usually buggy and _not_ working, most of the time. They're just not worth the hassle.This is my 2nd pair of Elite 7 Pro. First pair I bought a year ago started exhibiting all of the same problems mentioned in the headline.What's worse: after unpairing the earbuds from my device, doing a factory reset on the earbuds, and then setting 'em up again using the Jabra Sound+ app ... after a day or so, the Sound+ app will no longer ""recognize"" the earbuds. Although the earbuds might be paired (and working) with the device, upon opening the Sound+ app it will display instructions like ""Remove earbuds from the case and pair them to your phone"" ... as if I was setting up the earbuds for the first time.Also, somehow the earbuds very frequently seem to ""lose"" their interface or connection with Google Assistant. Within the Sound+ app, you're given a choice of either ""Amazon Alexa,"" ""Google Assistant,"" or ""Android Default."" I preferred to use the ""Android Default"" setting for the physical button Google Assistant prompts -- meaning, I would double-press the left earbud button. Using the ""Android Default"" setting allows you to adjust your connected media device's volume by pressing and holding the right earbud button (increase volume) or left earbud button (decrease volume). Well, these earbuds would go maybe a day on that ""Android Default"" setting before they stopped responding to the ""left button double-click"" prompt for ""Google Assistant.""Bottom Line: I've tried using these on 4 different Android devices, running Android 0S 9 thru 13. Eventually, these Elite 7 Pro earbuds exhibit the exact same problems. My bad experiences with both the 1st and 2nd sets of this model has turned me off from buying any Jabra earbuds in the future.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AFONOHMMJJYTSMWV5NKCWA2DXXFA,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"July 22, 2023",2023-07-22,2023-07,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds
R39X2FNODDIO0Y,B09D1HMBQ3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Great Fit, Horrible Microphone",John,2.0,"I'm on a quest to find a replacement for my old Samsung Galaxy Buds I left in a motel room. So far it hasn't been good. I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max, I have a pair of Airpods but they just don't fit me right, they fall out and the sound is poor. I prefer the earbud style too. After finding the new Samsung Buds aren't iPhone compatible I decided to look at Bose and Jabra. It came down to the Jabra Elite 7 Pro and the 85T, with the 7 Pro winning mainly due to size and good reviews.I received them, charged them and downloaded the Jabra app. They fit perfectly with the installed gels and were very comfortable. The app tuned them for my hearing, so I turned on some music and was pleased with the sound quality. The EQ needed no adjustment, they sounded pretty darn good just the way they were. I don't need ANC so I never tested it. I received a phone call and that's when the ugly came out. One minute the caller could hear me, then I just went away and they couldn't hear a word. Both buds, one bud, no difference. I blew it off and figured it must have been a fluke. Later I received another call and the exact same thing happened, except worse. The microphones worked for a few seconds then just stopped, then they'd come back on again but only for a few seconds. So, during the call I put them back in the box and packed them up to return them. The search for a good earbud continues.","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2022",AEMYZDNIEYXFEGXMN3OVOFUSTTBQ,1,0,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"November 25, 2022",2022-11-25,2022-11,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

Ray,5.0,"For the last few years, I've been using traditional wired earbud headphones when commuting, and Bose Quiet Comfort II noise-cancelling headphones when I travel. I can't really use the Apple ear buds because they just don't fit or stay in my ears at all. I used to use a Jabra bluetooth headset and I loved it, so I bought these Jabra ear buds. No regrets! I've been using them for a few months now and I love them, too!The sound quality when listening to music is excellent and rich and seems to fill my entire head. The microphone is equally high quality and calls are crystal clear. The earbuds fit into my small ears perfectly and comfortably (this never happens) and don't budge. It wasn't until I was getting the earbuds set up with my phone that I found out the sound is customized to the individual user's hearing, which I appreciate as I have some hearing loss in one ear. The noise cancellation is every bit as good as on my Bose over-ear headphones. The earbuds hold a charge for a very long time and recharge quickly. There is nothing about these I don't love.

R3DM1NIUP9N49K,B09D1HMBQ3,2.0 out of 5 stars Bad noise cancellation with sacrificial sound,Ethan,2.0,"I was really excited getting a pair of these from Prime Day sales. Shipping was great and package undamaged. However, I noticed several disappointing things about the earbuds. This is apparently common for android users, but the audio has a more than a half second delay. If you're listening to music it's not that big of a deal. When watching movies or playing games you notice the audio isn't in sync with what's on the screen which kills the experience. Sometimes in-between listening, the audio between earbuds aren't perfectly matched which sounds like you're hearing an echo. Another thing I don't like is the app. It has some interesting features, but the equalizer is so frustrating. You think you can raise the treble and bass as high as you like, but adjusting one causes the other to decrease in sound quality. Meaning you have to sacrifice having good bass, mids, or treble for the other while not capable of having all due to the speaker's limitations. No matter how you adjust them, it still sounds like listening to tin speakers. My final issue is with the mic. On phone calls, I been hearing a lot of remarks from people I talk to about there being background noise while I'm speaking. I tried adjusting noise cancellation and side call, but the static noise never fully went away. Overtime, the audio from me and the caller become distorted as though the earbuds are gradually dying when on 100% charge. I haven't had this problem with my $50 wired earbuds with a cheap $7 mic built into the cord. These costed more than my headphones and earbuds in base price and it failed to be anything better than either of them. The only thing you're really buying these for is being wireless and nothing more. Even though I'm sure there's better wireless earbuds out there if these have so many issues.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2022",AGOFOT2FW7MJB4IZR3YNHHUXSIMA,1,2,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"July 20, 2022",2022-07-20,2022-07,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

The fit is super comfortable, the battery life is fantastic, and most importantly, they don't fall out during a workout. Not a biggie, but maybe Jabra should consider adding a wing-tipped option for extra security or larger/smaller ear canals or ear openings.The Jabra Elite 7 pro is rated higher in water/dustproof than the previously mentioned ones (sony is IPX4, and the Jabra is IP57) which indicates they are protected against dust and the effects of temporary submersion in water.) They are currently $100 off MSRP ($200 is the price, holidays around $100)Sony adds this feature where it can ""tailor"" the sound based on tests, but the catch (and really BS) is that you have to sign on to one of 3 streaming services. That's nonsense, plus it gathers your bio based on these so-called (tests.)I can go on and on from a technical standpoint (audio engineer by trade,) but I'm going to keep it simple.

They fit my ears perfectly with the smallest earbud covers. Sometimes when I use earbuds for long periods of time it'll start hurting my ears. Not with these earbuds! I will say that changing the earbud covers is a little bit difficult, but that just may be me so I don't really find that to be a problem. My favorite thing about these earbuds is the hear through feature and the active noise cancellation. That means you can use them with noise cancellation when you need to focus and block out the outside world. Or you can use them with the hear through feature which allows you to hear the outside world without having to remove your earbuds from your ears. It uses the earbuds microphone to allow you to hear the outside noises and it sounds more enhanced too. I love that! The battery seems to last a long while. I haven't recharged since I received them. Oooh! Also the earbuds have an app called sound+ where you can control the music equalizer amongst other things. My favorite thing about the sound+ app though is the find my Jabra feature.

Also, I am not sure what causes this but almost seems like they are in a constant pair mode or at least are discoverable. It's annoying because when I am driving and get into traffic sometimes the units start cutting in and out, and thd only thing I can think of us there are other smart devices in the area looking to discover and pair with units. This does not happen alot, but when it does, it's annoying. I am hoping that the support team comes out with a software that will fix these minor but annoying issues.

There was basically no delay when watching any video from any app on my phone. I noticed other mainstream headsets failed to sync specifically with TikTok videos, resulting in noticable lag. And now I'm devastated that the Elite 7 Pro also fails this TikTok challenge, though slightly better than some competition. Recently, my 75t had no sound coming out of the right ear so I figured I'd be safe upgrading to the new and supposedly imporved Elite 7 Pro. Truly saddened by the Elite 7 Pro not meeting up to the apparently demanding audio synchronization that TikTok has on seemingly every other bluetooth headphone except probably AirPods for iPhones and the now 2 year old Elite 75t. Even the active noise cancellation seems better on the 75t and it wasn't even an expected feature until a surprise update brought it. Feels like Jabra is relying more on the ear piece suppressing sound through natural passive noice cancellation that seems more intense than the previous model. RIP Elite 75t. I can only hope future updates can make the Elite 7 Pro a true successor. I'd still recommend the Elite 7 Pro for great mic call quality, now allowing either earbud to be used independently which the 75t didn't have, the official IP rating, wireless charging case, and great battery life.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2021",AER2XK3SAEZCE7FT3KIHD33BPEUA,1,3,Color: Titanium BlackStyle: Elite 7 Pro,"October 18, 2021",2021-10-18,2021-10,Jabra,Jabra Elite 7 Pro - True Wireless Earbuds

I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work.

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4STD5ZC,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4.0,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"June 28, 2024",2024-06-28,2024-06,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4STD5ZC,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4.0,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 10, 2024",2024-07-10,2024-07,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4STD5ZC,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5.0,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 1, 2024",2024-07-01,2024-07,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4STD5ZC,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5.0,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,0,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 13, 2024",2024-07-13,2024-07,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4STD5ZC,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5.0,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"June 30, 2024",2024-06-30,2024-06,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker

Needs more buttons,Carpe_Diem,3.0,"This Bluetooth speaker is on the higher end of the price range for a small form factor speaker.Priced similarly to the JBL Extreme 2 (which I also have) the sound quality is about the same. Which is to say, very good for a small speaker.Compared to the JBL, the Beats Pill is:Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality.Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap (which you can also use to hang the speaker)Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing.My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons. There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface. If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,"July 19, 2024",2024-07-19,2024-07,Beats,Beats Pill - Portable Wireless Speaker

You can pair two of them and get stereo separation, but in my opinion, that would be a bit contrary to one of its main features, portability. In any case, the sound quality that comes out is full and rich including low-end. I've been listening to my favorite music through this speaker, music I've heard since the 70s through all manner of listening devices from full-featured stereo systems to Walkman headset units, and the listening experience through this speaker is beautiful.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AGH4ZFHPMEDDJFWGXMIRZ7HX7A3A,1,0,Color: White Smoke,"July 5, 2024",2024-07-05,2024-07,Beats,nan

Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

RMUYYKJ5WTA8Q,B099TLMRB6,4.0 out of 5 stars The sound is awesome but...,HB,4.0,"It's a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that. It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected.

R36YHGL95K3QBJ,B099TLMRB6,3.0 out of 5 stars there‚Äôs a time and place for it!,Steven Jerome Staten II,3.0,"I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TLMRB6,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5.0,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,1,0,Color: Black,"May 4, 2024",2024-05-04,2024-05,Beats,nan
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TLMRB6,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5.0,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,1,0,Color: Black,"July 2, 2024",2024-07-02,2024-07,Beats,nan

I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me. Now let‚Äôs see if the battery life is legit. I‚Äôll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,1,0,Color: Green,"July 18, 2024",2024-07-18,2024-07,Beats,nan

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TLMRB6,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Caitriona Gillespie,5.0,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,1,0,Color: Chilled Lilac,"June 15, 2024",2024-06-15,2024-06,Beats,nan

R60WZUIBGEU1K,B07GWRCZQP,5.0 out of 5 stars Returned Charge 5's and bought these,Christo,5.0,"THE FOLLOWING IS A REVIEW I LEFT FOR THE CHARGE 5 SPEAKERS. THE COMPARISON WITH THE CHARGE 4 IS AT THE UPDATE NEAR THE END OF THE REVIEW!-------------------I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,1,0,Color: White,"December 15, 2023",2023-12-15,2023-12,JBL,nan

R9MISQR71RN59,B07GWRCZQP,5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with this purchase,JT,5.0,"Initially, my preference was the Bose Soundlink Mini II with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in a small transportable package; that is, until I heard comparison against a JBL Charge 4 on YouTube. Based on that review and others, I purchased this speaker for its waterproof, multi-connect and sound.Great price: You can buy a Charge 3 direct from JBL for $129 with 12 color options, with price point being on par with Amazon.Sounds great; EXCELLENT better describes it. If you have a Charge 3 there isn't enough improvement to justify buying a Charge 4. The Charge 4 went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from 65Hz to a deeper 60Hz. When the JBL arrived we conducted our own comparison against a Bose Soundlink Mini II and - Wow. The Charge 4 is much clearer, has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room. It's a bit larger and heavier than the Soundlink Mini II which might turn some off, but to me; if I'm going to carry any speaker like this then I'm taking the same care and am sure I can find just a little more room.Good packaging but NO INSTRUCTIONS?! Not that charging and setup are all that difficult, but this is my first device that requires USB C, first anything that arrived with ZERO printed information, and rechargeable device that arrived with ZERO anything to charge it with. /// Setup was easy. I bought a USB C cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for 3 hours since it came somewhat charged already. Once charged, press the Bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device. For settings, I always recommend phone volume to be no more than 1/2 to 3/4 volume then using the Charge 4 volume from there. This affords you plenty of up/down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn't task the internal sound processor....this, since it's cheaper to replace/repair a Charge 4 than an expensive smartphone. You and someone else can be Bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time.Battery Life: The built-in rechargeable Li-ion 7500mAH battery is strong. Not only does it support up to 20 hours of playtime (at lowest setting, and figure 10 hours at half volume), but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the USB port. I strongly suggest buying a protective case for it which will hold your charger, USB C charging cable AND any spare USB cable needed for cell phones.It has the same IPX7 waterproof as a iPhone, Samsung or other higher end smartphone. We place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills, big splashes, being left in the rain, or even an accidental swim in the pool. Having that peace of mind alone is priceless.JBL Connect+: With Connect+ you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience. Put 4 in opposing corners of a large room, in different rooms, indoor and outdoors...heck, even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap.Bottom line - this being my FIRST Bluetooth speaker ever, and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have, I have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs. Bang for buck is spot on. I have excellent sound in a transportable package in a wireless speaker that is rugged, waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect.

I have used it for several days in a row for 4 to 5 hours at a time and never depleted the battery. My only wish is that I had bought it after the Charge 4 was upgraded and could link to a second speaker for larger areas.,"Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AGTV5JS72GJDEEVISNPXPENT5GIQ,1,0,Color: Blue,"June 11, 2024",2024-06-11,2024-06,JBL,nan

R1KA2X3UDYW28,B07GWRCZQP,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Directional Sound!,WeirdHarold,5.0,"I did my research, looking for a great speaker to use primarily outdoors while I work on projects in the yard - Gardening, Landscaping etc. I needed 2 main things for me- Battery Life and Good Rich Sound that could be heard wherever I might be working. This Speaker checked off all the correct things, so I took a risk and it did not disappoint!Like other reviews have noted, this has a directional sound. You can hear it far better if you are in front of it than you can from behind it, as the sound becomes rather softened or muffled from behind. This is perfect for what I wanted as I can aim it to the area that I'm working in and the sound is focused directly there. The sound is loud enough to be heard while out in the yard and clear enough that you can understand an audiobook being played. It has great highs, good mids and decent bass - Far better bass than I was expecting and the best bass I've ever heard out of a portable speaker. Will it keep us with a full sized Sub, not a chance, but it sounds amazing for it's size! The battery life is absolutely a game changer, every other portable speaker I've ever owned would require me to charge it at least once a day if I used it for most of a day while in the yard. I've been on vacation now for 9 days and I've been using it an average of 4 hours a day and it still shows 3 out of the 5 dots on the battery meter on the front.I do not regret this purchase one bit and would suggest it to anyone looking for a great speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF7CNCMIKP7DJHBPWBFXWRZ4BV2A,1,0,Color: Blue,"March 8, 2024",2024-03-08,2024-03,JBL,nan

R1C88J52WBNRHJ,B07GWRCZQP,5.0 out of 5 stars If only the battery was better.,Skyler,5.0,"Unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, I used it for work. As a FedEx Express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we don't have speakers! Imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress!So one night I decided, no more of that. This speaker fit right into the passengers ""seat"", and I would strap the seatbelt just incase (the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying).With that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around 4 or 5 hours. But man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything. It made my driving experience so much better. That being said, I would only need full volume on the highway (did you know Express trucks are governed to 65mph? Well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that. At least in my station they all had check engine lights and I once timed that it took 27 seconds to go from 40mph to 65mph. Fun!) and when I was driving from 30-50mph having the speaker at ~70% was fine. At that rate I could make it last about 8 hours before needing a recharge.I thank JBL for creating such a great speaker and frankly I am sure their other products have that battery capacity I needed, but I got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack. For the situation I was in, it was a total game changer. I went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs. On the off-chance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery. I will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind.Luckily I do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when I needed it, my life was much better for it. It sat next to an open door in an Isuzu Reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while. I know now anything and everything I might throw at it will never take it down. If battery life is your concern, it is valid. If you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my ""doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at 45mph still sounding good"" seal of approval!","Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2022",AFPDW2XBKCY6GSQVZHLZPTXNQGXA,1,0,Color: Red,"August 28, 2022",2022-08-28,2022-08,JBL,nan

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5.0,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,1,0,Color: Black,"April 5, 2024",2024-04-05,2024-04,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker
R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you‚Äôre an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint.

They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,1,0,Color: White,"December 15, 2023",2023-12-15,2023-12,JBL,JBL Charge 5 - Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

However, I‚Äôve found that when outside, the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on. It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy.

R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GK5JMHK,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5.0,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I‚Äôve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I‚Äôve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I‚Äôve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you‚Äôre entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you‚Äôre able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can‚Äôt help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6,"April 27, 2024",2024-04-27,2024-04,Sony,nan

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GK5JMHK,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5.0,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you‚Äôll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6,"February 19, 2024",2024-02-19,2024-02,Sony,nan

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5.0,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,1,0,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"October 1, 2022",2022-10-01,2022-10,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4.0,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It‚Äôs approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it‚Äôs a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,1,0,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"February 28, 2024",2024-02-28,2024-02,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5.0,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,1,0,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"January 10, 2024",2024-01-10,2024-01,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5.0,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton,"February 20, 2024",2024-02-20,2024-02,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker
R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5.0,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house.

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters ‚Äì B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker ‚Äì and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed. I'm a convert and already planning to surround myself with more of these pocket-sized wonders!Cheers,","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AEWYYN4J3I3I5IIF5QNOBAF4GYIQ,1,0,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,"January 27, 2024",2024-01-27,2024-01,Marshall,Marshall Emberton II - Portable Bluetooth Speaker

So even though he loathed me for landing the girl, I made it a point to return his speaker to him & ordered one of my very own immediately after. Yea, I coulda just kept his, but after hearing that thing I instantly knew & understood how much he valued that speaker. Also knowing it was worth the money I really didn‚Äôt mind just buying one for me. Hopefully this little story can convey how highly I rate this speaker.

RLGGILF2KV5HQ,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars This Little Speaker is Seriously Impressive,Julian,5.0,"Pros:- Sound quality is the best in it's class. This speaker has lots of depth and is rich, immersive and crystal clear. I find that when I listen to this speaker about a foot or two away on my desk, it sounds so, so rich - especially with low-fi songs. The 360-sound effect creates a very immersive stereo effect. You learn to appreciate and notice it with more usage. Overall, I enjoy how this speaker sounds with most genres - especially genres with clear instrumentals and vocals. This is clearly not a giant bass monster due to its size, but the depth and richness in the bass is surprising, especially when set up about a foot away from a wall. Overall, I would give the sound quality a 10/10 compared to the many other speakers I have tested in the past (Sony, JBL, etc..). This may not be the loudest speaker for the price, but it is definitely the most hi-fi when compared to the other mono-sounding options. Personally, I find that it gets VERY loud for casual listening. Nonetheless, the sound that comes out of this little speaker is trippy. it gives off the impression (mainly when it's close to you) that you're listening to a large, rich speaker. It's also worth mentioning that the quality is retained even in lower volumes.- Design. Easily the most beautiful bluetooth speaker I've had. Made from nothing but premium materials and it looks beautiful. Not much else to say here. It's also really tiny which makes it more adorable and portable. Perfect for picnics.- Battery life. As I mentioned earlier, this thing gets plenty loud. I usually play music at around 30% on this speaker and find that it is plenty loud for casual listening. Most people may opt for 50% while around the house. Regardless, the battery life is insanely good. This efficiency in battery life has to do with the type of amplifier this speaker is.Cons:- Hmm... I can't really think of any. I feel that it is priced fairly. While you can buy slightly bigger, more powerful speakers, they will simply lack the depth and richness in sound coming from this little thing. This is more of a high-quality listening experience compared to the ""boominess"" of larger speakers that feel like the sound is being muddled through some sort of barrier. Point is, anything below the retail price is a steal for this awesome speaker.Overall, this is such an awesome and special little speaker. It's hard to compare because it's very distinct in it's own unique way when you factor in the crazy 360 audio + amazing clarity and richness in bass. They really nailed this one.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021",AHCJJ56LCEOOVCREE23TC6BY3FCQ,1,0,Unknown,"March 14, 2021",2021-03-14,2021-03,Sennheiser,nan
R2XUYU4VTT9WR7,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Marshall vs. Bose Soundlink Flex vs. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore : This Wins hands down.,Kindle Customer,5.0,"Purchased all the three of the above portable bluetooth speakers as the JBL flip I have had for years had only one volume (Loud) and sounded more and more as it was coming through a tin can. When I lived alone I could crank music on my stereo through high end gear in most of the house, but now I have to be more considerate of my roommate. I suspected none of the offerings in the class of speaker were going to be great, but wanted something that at least didn't make my fingernails itch. As I get tired of wearing ear buds/head phones, decided this was the perfect opportunity to try an upgrade. Thanks to all the purchasers who did reviews, it helps to limit the field and I do rely heavily on customer feedback in making a buying decision.So in last place without even listening to anything else was the Bose Soundlink Flex. It only sounded marginally better than the old one I have which is terrible. If that was as good as it gets I would have just stuck with constantly wearing earbuds.In the middle was the Ban & Olufsen Beosound Expore. The sound was much fuller and less muddy. While it wasn't great it was tolerable. A bonus was that you got sound all around so would be perfect when you are working and moving in the room. While significantly heavier and bulkier than the Bose, it was in the middle size wise as the Marshall was without question the largest of the three. The app was nice as well although I don't like using those to control my speakers particularly when working because my hands are usually busy and messy and don't want to be handling the phone constantly. It had a small strap for carrying but it was definitely going to need to be clipped on to something very securely if you are moving around with it.The Marshall won by a mile. The sound was far more full, less muddy and with sound coming out both forwards and rear continued to give an all around sound as opposed to one direction of sound. Perhaps size is a function of sound quality because without question it is the largest. it is also the best looking. As I plan to use this around my house, it is perfectly fine in size and if the sound hadn't been tolerable I was going to go evetn bigger with a plugged in blue tooth speaker even though that would have been a pain in the butt.Am I getting the quality of sound I would prefer? No of course not and I wasn't expecting to as size is a clear element in recreation of sound. I don't know if this will be as sturdy as the other two. Both of them seemed encased in .more shock absorbing materials.This was also the most expensive but not significantly more. Given the vast improvement in sound quality I was more than willing to pay a bit more and the Prime Day sale price definitely helped.I will update with use. I would have posted a video but based on my own listening to reviews, I realize that they are truly not helpful because what you are listening on will be big part of the sound you are hearing.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AHJLVEDB5WVDCHC4U5BHOVCBKKCQ,1,0,Unknown,"July 14, 2023",2023-07-14,2023-07,Sennheiser,nan
R1KWE7CB7TIS3C,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive acoustic output in a small package,Mark Mitchell,5.0,"The Marshall Stockwell II certainly lives up to the Marshall reputation. My audio experience and extensive audio knowledge in speaker system and crossover network design spans almost 5 decades. The Marshall Stockwell II most certainly takes advantage of soft and hard surface geometry for tailoring to individual psychoacoustic tastes and preferences. The bass and treble controls offer outstanding range of boost and cut in broad frequency spectrums. This is absolutely the BEST portable for its size on the market. Clear, clean audio at all reproduction levels and can be pushed into slight fuzz at extremes. I will be buying more Marshall portables in the near future.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AFVOFIKCFUKYXKUVPNJBYAWOR7WQ,1,0,Unknown,"July 23, 2024",2024-07-23,2024-07,Sennheiser,nan
R31MXTZXOVQYOG,B088KRKFJ3,4.0 out of 5 stars Loud enough,Rachel in Washington,4.0,"Great unit. Was a bit worried that it wasn't loud enough when I first got it, then I remembered that you can control the volume not only with the knobs on this unit but also with your phone; once I jacked up the volume control on my phone, it was louder than I'll probably ever need it to be. The sound is noticeably richer/fuller than a cheaper, smaller portable Marshall speaker I tried, so it was an easy decision to keep this one and return the other. The other reason I prefer this unit is this one has treble and bass controls. I'm not sure how I feel about the strap, so I'm glad it can be tucked behind the unit out of sight, and I'm glad it's detachable. It looks like an adorable little baby amp without the strap. The unit was very easy to pair with my phone and didn't require installing a new app. It came with a charging cord but not the chunky little cube that the cord plugs into to plug into an electrical outlet, which was a little disappointing, but I had another one that I use for another purpose that I was able to use, so I guess we're saving the environment by not having a dedicated chunky cube for this unit, which admittedly I don't anticipate needing to charge very often. All in all I'm very happy with this speaker; I'm deducting one star only because it would be nice if it could go louder, given the price. It's just barely loud enough but it would be nice if it could knock my socks off and be something I could be confident would be loud enough for a house party.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2023",AFXIGBFBX6UHWTAE5YEEWIMAZWNA,1,0,Unknown,"September 9, 2023",2023-09-09,2023-09,Sennheiser,nan

R32K5TTVL773ND,B088KRKFJ3,1.0 out of 5 stars Bad - previous Marshall Customer (long review),Caffeine & Curate,1.0,"This is gonna be a long detailed review for those of you that really like a lot of detail!1. I am a previous customer of a Marshall, portable speaker - Kilburn 1 - I‚Äôve had this for a few years and I have yet to ever have a problem with Bluetooth pairing. I only use it when I want to feel surroundsound on my flatscreen TV or I want to plug it to my Crosley record player - so other than that it just sits and waits for me to use it and it is still working till this day!That one cost me a pretty penny as well I think into the $299 range but the reason I was looking for some thing smaller with the handle was the Kilburn original is super heavy.I wanted a smaller Marshall speaker because they look beautiful, I wanted a handle for the portability of moving it between my bathroom my kitchen in my office space when I‚Äôm listening to music and podcasts.2. Let‚Äôs talk about the review of the actual product. Spoiler Alert: there isn‚Äôt much to say because I could not pair it. I even let it re-charge overnight just in case even though it said it was fully charged at arrival.I tried pairing it with two different iPhones. I don‚Äôt need to try anymore than this.! I have owned multiple JBL, portable speakers, and other cheaper brands and pairing has never been a problem!So for any product to take this long to try to pair means that Marshall really made a horrible product or a really big, horrible batch considering the other negative reviews on the Bluetooth pairing, and the item going out after six months or even a year!* the other thing I noticed the very last time I tried to pair it was the moment I turned the volume knob to turn on the device. I heard a split second of a static sound, and I knew that wasn‚Äôt good.!This item arrived as a refurbished item so I had gotten it for $145. I was super excited because I buy a lot of Amazon refurbished products including very expensive Apple products, and I can‚Äôt tell you how wonderful of an experience I‚Äôve had buying refurbished or used or open box where some products would arrive mostly completely blemish free! And they would last a long time!So I will be returning this and considering this defective when I return it. If it doesn‚Äôt work out of the box, it‚Äôs not going to work and it‚Äôs not a good product and that‚Äôs my very strong opinion when it comes to any electronics that you purchase.Marshall, if you‚Äôre reading this, considering your other reviews, you made a really bad product you need to reconsider your manufacturer and may be any possible shortcutsI really specifically wanted this for the size of how small it was and the awesome handle that came with it so if you can remake this product, I would still buy and try it in the future! This honestly would‚Äôve been the most perfect size for my little one bedroom apartment and I‚Äôm really sad to say I don‚Äôt think I want to try paying more for a brand new one considering the reviews that it may end up going out in six months or a year.I have JBL portable speakers that are still going strong and they at least go strong for 2 1/2 years and they cost a third of the price!","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023",AGYZFA3V2LHRBMGVCO4KFGFRV33A,1,1,Unknown,"October 28, 2023",2023-10-28,2023-10,Sennheiser,nan

I snagged the Stockwell II on WHD for 140 and it is undoubtedly the best BT speaker in my small collection.Moving up from mainly a Divoom Outdoor2 it's such a difference. The sound is FULL and the onboard EQ edjustments are a real luxury. Bass is balanced, not boomy! Not muddy! Very clean.For those who don't know the Outdoor2 and Stockwell II both have drivers on both the front and back of the speakers. The soundstage and stereo separation effects this does has now become a must-have for me. I don't think I can't use a BT speaker that doesn't produce ""360"" sound in this way.The Stockwell 2 is the best off-axis, walk around the house, portable speaker I can think of. It sounds great from so many angles instead of just front and center. I love this thing. The black and brass version is super sleek.Main cons: It's not super duper loud. If you're taking this outside with other noises you'd be better off with a larger boombox style speaker. This probably won't cut it for you. Volume settings 1-5 *are* pretty low vs. other boomier, muddier, mono sounding BT speakers.6-8 are mostly where I stay9-10 imo are plenty loud and would definitely disturb my upstairs neighbor.In conclusion, the Stockwell 2 is all about sound quality. And it provides that whether you're at 10% or 100% volume - across all genres. Extreme metal, synthwave, R&B, you name it, it's got you covered. Drop any bias towards the Marshall brand name - this speaker lives up to any hype and is worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021",AH2BBTHCLJ7EGLZTWSSZ3QPUJCHQ,1,0,Unknown,"January 5, 2021",2021-01-05,2021-01,Sennheiser,nan

R2A8QIX56R5FIJ,B088KRKFJ3,"3.0 out of 5 stars good for some things, not for other things",mano,3.0,"it sounds good and is great to carry around, and it's ideal if you're hanging out/working and want to have music in the background the whole time.but if you have an A.D.D. style of going about your day, it has drawbacks. i work from home and end up having multiple devices connected to it, and it seems to be fighting over each other. i'll connect my music to it from my ipad, but my computer instantly knocks it out even if nothing's playing, so i have to disconnect my computer from it, or if i go on social media on my phone it will switch to that. also it disconnects sooner than later. if i pause music so i can take a phone call, i'd have to turn the speaker off and on all the time so it can reconnect. i also wanted to use it for ramshackle tech for a live show, which was a mistake, because it takes like ten seconds for it to recognize that sound is going in, even if you're connected through the aux. so the ""attack"" is awful, not to mention how quickly it turns off after being idle for like a minute.also i got it to replace my very old bose bluetooth speaker, whose sound started cracking. went for this because you can control the bass and treble, because i live in a small apt building and bass carries easily and it drives me nuts when my neighbor's bass reverberates in my room. so i figured if i turn down my bass i wouldn't bother anyone, but even with the bass knob at zero, it's still bass-y. i mean, it still sounds great, but i get self conscious.anyway, in conclusion: it's amazing for continuous music, bad if you jump around. like everyone says, it's surprisingly not LOUD loud, but good enough for my small apartment/hanging with a small group of friends outside.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2021",AEWKQGFYSL6FNDG43RNNACCPYMGA,1,2,Unknown,"May 15, 2021",2021-05-15,2021-05,Sennheiser,nan

R18SXR7BES3PP9,B088KRKFJ3,2.0 out of 5 stars Bass is awful,Stephen,2.0,"Gave it a shot. It has a very warm sound however that's drowned out by the ""punchy"" bass. I bought this because it was relatively low in volume and I didn't need much of a space to fill with sound. However, the bass is atrocious. Bass is meant to be felt not heard and all i hear is someone trying to punch my ear drums with every song. I do have tinitus so i can be sensitive to bass however the Stockwell 2 just slams it at you even with low volume and bass dial all the way down. Build quality and look is fantastic, i wish it worked out because of that. But I have heard other Marshall speakers in stores and they were all Bass over clarity. Hopefully they can come out with something with a more neutral sound, clarity, and no horrible ""punchy bass"".

R2DRA7FKP4LV9F,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars The best bluetooth speaker I've ever had,Jenna,5.0,"I bought this on sale for Prime Day two and a half years ago and it has been truly amazing. Being able to adjust the treble/bass is awesome for listening to different types of music. The sound feels so true and rich. It is portable and the little handle is awesome, but be aware it is very dense. It's not light but it is small and to me, that is not a downside but this isn't the sort of speaker you'd want to hang from a backpack and walk around with all day.The battery life is insane. I will actually go months between charging it with regular use. There was some review I read before buying this that said the volume control style (not a 1 to 1 increase in sound for how you turn the knob, it's exponential instead so the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the turning doesn't do much but any tweaking in the last 1/3 of the dial does a TON to change the volume) takes a lot less power than ""regular"" volume control and that's part of what makes the battery life so great. If I had to guess, I would say I've charged this speaker less than 10 times over two and a half years.I don't think I'll ever get a different brand of bluetooth speaker than Marshall after how amazing this has been. But it seems this little speaker is holding up so well, I won't have to shop for quite a long time.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2022",AGVCTW3LKB5Z5PU3UQVS2ATJ67GQ,0,0,Unknown,"May 5, 2022",2022-05-05,2022-05,Sennheiser,nan

R29NJME9GM5IVB,B08Z1RP9K8,5.0 out of 5 stars Another EXCELLENT Sonos product,J. Sanchez,5.0,"I am an owner of two Sonos home speakers: the One and the One SL. These are amazing sounding speakers that are easy to use. While I love these speakers, they are not portable as they must stay plugged into an outlet in order to work. I looked at the Sonos Move but was turned off by the size of the speaker and the high price. Needless to say, when Sonos introduced the Roam, I was intrigued. I got it as a father's day gift and what follows are my thoughts on the new Sonos Roam.SoundMy main concern with the Roam was that I noticed it was rather small and how that would effect the sound quality and loudness of the speaker. I was foolish for thinking this however. Sonos is known for having excellent sounding speakers and they would not jeopardize that reputation by putting out a new product that didn't adhere to their high audio standards. This speaker sounds amazing! Music sounds rich and full of depth. The clarity of the highs is excellent and the bass is surprisingly rich and full. Further to the point, the Sonos app allows you to tailor the sound to your liking, adding more of less treble and/or bass. I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the audio quality of this diminutive speaker.As a secondary point under sound, I was also concerned about how loud the speaker could get. Indoors, this little gem can get plenty loud and fill a large space with amazing sound. Outdoors, the Roam does a better than adequate job of projecting great music. I have taken it in my backyard while doing some yard work and it gets loud enough to hear and enjoy the music. However, I don't think Sonos designed this speaker to pump out the tunes at the pool party or at the beach like the EU Boom 3 or other larger bluetooth speakers. It can function adequately in that role but excels in smaller spaces and in overall sound quality.FunctionalityThe speaker works seamlessly with my other two Sonos speakers via WiFi using the Sonos app. The ability to move the speaker all over the house is a major plus. I can configure the Roam to play alone or with either one or both of my other speakers. I love that versatility. The buttons have some straight forward uses and also are multi-functional, which can take some getting used to. For example, I have issues sometimes with the power button and how long to push it. Five seconds to turn it off, a quick push to put it in sleep mode to save power. Same with the play/pause button: once to pause music, twice to advance to the next song, three times to go back to previous song, press and hold for a second to put the speaker in bluetooth pairing mode, and press and hold and listen for a sound in order to be able to swap your music from the Roam to the closest Sonos speaker or vice versa. It has taken some getting used to initially but I'm getting the hang of it.The battery life is good but I wish it were better. I get about 8 hours of play time per charge. Charging is another small issue. Sonos includes a USB-C (plugs into speaker) to USB-A (plugs into charger) charging cable with the speaker, but they do not include a charging adapter to plug into the wall. Luckily, I have an Apple iPad USB-C to USB-C cable with a large 20w charging adapter that charges the Roam very quickly. I highly recommend the larger charging adapter to greatly reduce charging time. As a side note, the speaker can function fully while being charged.Airplay and bluetooth connectivity are straightforward and work well. I have not had any issues connecting the speaker via bluetooth to my phone, laptop and various other devices around my home.FormThe speaker works in either a horizontal or vertical position with some claiming there is a difference in the sound. That is a matter of preference as I like both positions for different reasons. Horizontally, the speaker is designed to project the sound up and it seems to use the surface the speaker is sitting on to amplify the sound. Vertically it sounds great and it is much easier to access the control buttons on top. Ultimately, I love the design of the Roam because it is small, clean and elegant looking.In my opinion, the Sonos Roam is an excellent speaker because of its portability, convenience of use within my existing Sonos system, and its superb audio performance.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2021",AF6SKKQSAPY2Q4GAS2DOPQBL7SOA,1,0,Size: SingleColor: White,"June 24, 2021",2021-06-24,2021-06,Anker,nan
RHGO648CL0OJY,B08Z1RP9K8,5.0 out of 5 stars Love the speaker but found an airplay issue,Miguel Gracia,5.0,"I really like this speaker, it is unique in the market because it is small, portable, wireless (can connect to your wifi ) and Bluetooth capable. I love to use it at home as desktop airplay speaker. One thing I experienced one time is when the speaker reached ~40% battery the airplay connection started to failed, sound was cutting really bad and I was not able to play continuously. not even I turned off/on. Once I connected to the power the problem was fixed so I am not sure if that was a glitch or something real. A second thing I don't like is that currently you have to open the SONOS app to check the battery level while airplaying it , I wish you can do the same from the airplay menu maybe that is an apple problem. Difficult to write about sound quality, I can only tell how it sounds compare to a apple homepod mini (similar sound quality less loud) , Bose Micro soundlink (Sonos has much better sound quality and louder) Bose Mini soundlink (Sonos has better sound quality, less bass, less loud) JBL clip 4 (sonos has ultra much better quality ). Overall I think this is the best small/micro sound system in the market, don't buy JBL clip 4 or Bose micro soundlink those are trash compare to this one.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFXJZ2PDN44L26NJFK2TGXKXTWXQ,1,0,Size: SingleColor: Black,"June 28, 2022",2022-06-28,2022-06,Anker,nan

RCP5UH68U3S6L,B08Z1RP9K8,3.0 out of 5 stars Sonos' most disappointing product is almost acceptable,JOSHUA,3.0,"The Roam is a small speaker, for which you're going to have to expect lower audio quality. This thing definitely does not have the somewhat richer sound of a One. Being able to pop the plug and take it with me is great and the battery life is excellent but the Roam has some pretty significant flaws that would make me not recommend it.It has very fine-grained volume controls yet everything below about 25% is almost completely inaudible. With other Sonos products you can comfortably set the volume to 10% and have an enjoyable listening experience. With the Roam you're going to literally wonder if it's on at all until you turn it up to about 28. It doesn't matter what source you use -- a test signal at full signal won't even be audible in the lower 20% of the volume band.This leads to the second problem: if you set the volume to a point where you can actually hear music, the Alexa voice is EAR SHATTERINGLY LOUD. If you set the volume to the point where Alexa isn't trying to make you have a heart attack, your music is inaudible.The software's a bit buggy as well. It can't be paired with any of your other speakers but it can be grouped with them. If you group the Roam with another speaker that's playing you have about a 50/50 shot of it just not doing anything at all. It'll be connected, the controls will respond, it'll be visible in the app as grouped, you just won't get any audio. After a little fooling around with it, you can sometimes work around the problem by starting the playback on the Roam and grouping something else to it. Adding the Roam to a group doesn't work reliably at all.Some other software bugs make this thing a bit less fun. While it remembers if it was last used in Bluetooth or in Sonos mode and will return to the selected mode when turned on again, it's not very reliable to switch between modes. This isn't something you normally have to do often unless you take your Roam out of the house a lot; just leaving it in the Sonos network is viable wherever your WiFi reaches. Take it on a trip, though, and you're going to spend the first 4 or 5 minutes trying to get it to actually switch into Bluetooth mode.Re-pairing the Bluetooth is similarly annoying. It doesn't pair with more than a single device so it's extra steps for switching who's DJing. This isn't a problem while the Roam is at home and participating in your Sonos setup, of course.My real complaint, though, and something that was exceedingly poorly documented when the product was released is that it DOES NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING except another Roam.Battery life, as I said, is great. This comes at something of a cost, though: this sucker is way heavier than it looks. Personally, I'd have preferred half the (excellent!) battery life if it meant more room in there for better actual speakers. The audio is, really, barely passable at best and outright embarrassing for something Sonos branded.It is not tunable with TruePlay. It claims to have some kind of automatic TruePlay learning mode but I have not in any way noticed an improvement in the disappointing sound quality with it running.The Roam is definitely better than a no-name Bluetooth speaker you'd buy at Target. That faint praise is the strongest endorsement I can give it. If you want to pay nearly two Franklins for something that sounds pretty close to a $16 thing you bought when you went to pick up motor oil, the Roam is it.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2022",AGZ4XODB2UJ4NPOBG5WUPBF6JYIA,1,0,Size: SingleColor: Black,"September 18, 2022",2022-09-18,2022-09,Anker,nan

Got the Roam even after reading about the difficulty setting it up. It took days to sort out the issue which required my own workaround.Sonos has been trying to force the software update to the S2 app, which will not work with my older equipment. When trying to set up the Roam, I installed the S2 app, connected to a separate Wi-Fi network, but, as many users report, I could not set up a new account as any email address I entered was reported as ‚Äúalready in use‚Äù, which was impossible. Once I called Sonos, that issue disappeared which is suspicious. I wonder if they have something internal to prevent this.Sonos support told me to unplug all my devices, then set up the Roam on a split system which I refused to do as I did not want to risk my old equipment not working. Once you set up S2, you cannot revert back, so do not do this.I ignored their advice, and was somehow able to create the new Sonos account and activate my Roam. All that should be unnecessary for users like me that only want it for Bluetooth play.To Sonos - if you want to be in the Bluetooth market, change your software to enable Bluetooth only and stop trying to force loyal customers to the S2.

First, nothing about this set up is intuitive. The instructions are a joke, because they are almost non-existent. I spent two hours figuring out the steps through a myriad of YouTube videos, the Sonos website, and following the instructions on the app. First you need to download the app, set up an account, and connect to your Wifi and Bluetooth (if you want Bluetooth), information which is non-existent in the sparse instructions. Another feature that could use improvement are the buttons. The top with the volume and mike controls are hard to see and the button on the back is a bit funky. I didn't rate this product on the battery life since I've only had it for a short time. The saving grace for this product is the sound quality, which seems fairly good.

I went through every troubleshooting procedure possible on so many different occasions with the Sonos company, that I have lost count. I can get one speaker to work correctly, but I cannot get both speakers to work at the same time with any consistency. While one speaker is working and playing music perfectly fine the other one will play music for a couple of minutes and then it will cut out for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and then just come back on for no apparent reason. Sometimes it‚Äôs the front speaker. Sometimes it‚Äôs the back speaker.

It's like it's still on to some degree even after you press the button to turn it off. Most of the time when I went to use it it was completely dead. One time, I charged it back up and it wouldn't connect to my WiFi or let me pair it via Bluetooth to my iPhone. I had to factory reset it and set it up again.I ended up returning it. Sonos quality has gone down in recent years IMO. I don't really recommend them anymore. Multi room audio and portable audio from lots of other manufacturers has gotten just as good or better than Sonos these days.UPDATE just want to say that this device is by far the worst portable speaker I have ever seen. Unknown to me my girlfriend bought this because we were going on vacation. Getting aside from that fact that this device MUST be setup on wi-fi before it can be used (it thinks that a Hampton Inn in Miami is the ""home"" wifi), we had to reset this device no less than 6 times. Just like with mine half the time it had no battery, but even better when we would try to charge it, all we would get is a solid orange light. It would never charge, and would not turn on. If we unplugged/replugged the power tons of times, eventually it would start charging, but frequently would not connect to the wifi and would not show up in anyone's bluetooth. Can't tell you how frustrating this was, resetting the device, resetting the app, trying both of our phones. Maddening. She ended up returning it and getting a normal UE Megaboom bluetooth speaker, that thing is a joy to use and is actually reliable unlike the Sonos junk.

If I wanted to add a song to my current queue, it was a simple 2 click operation.However, for some reason, they decided to roll out an app update that eliminated all options to modify the current queue. In addition, they app has no ability to modify system settings, so when I changed my wifi password (which I do on a monthly basis), I lost the connection to all of my devices.

Asthetics easy 10 out of 10.Now let's get to the honest opinions when sony first announced this this I was definitely overjoyed but definitely said do to the size there has to be a little more hardware such as a tweeter included. Unfortunately the was not the case as pur usual sony overlooked an easy detail. Don't get me wrong this thing sounds good and yes the EQ does help the sound treble and bass can be improved but Ultimately it's just to obvious this could have been better with a tweeter! There is just this sence of slight muffle or just not high enough in terms of volume I have to turn this to about 70% for it to keep up with the charge 5 volume at about 50%. I really like this and wanted it to be greater then it is but 200 does not justify this thing the 2 woofers can easily handle mids with no problem and are ok with highs but seriously sony why no tweeter u have plenty of space in this thing. The defuser works ok the sound doesn't feel super directional but doesn't seem as wide spread as they advertise. U want this to fill your room maximum with the EQ tweaked is the way to do it! Maybe sony was trying to avoid a large amount of distortionion because it is quite minimal at maximum wich is really good! And yes the microphone function is really solid so props to them for that!Enough rambling all in all its a nice sounding well built speaker but 200 ...nah... may return it and buy it back later if I find it for Luke 120-130 ish for that 200 there is definitely bigger to equal size speakers with better performance!

R37T10HJZZ7BQZ,B0B445JCZ3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, great value, recommend, USE EQUALIZER",TG,5.0,"The media could not be loaded. This is one of the best mobile speakers I have heard. It also makes a great speaker phone addition and suppresses noise from either party. A huge difference between just your phone and this when the other party is driving (all car noise is gone as compared to my phone by itself; huge difference). I purchased mine on a Biz trip in Europe, paid 80 Euros for SRS-XE300 Amazon.de .Here are some of my finding which should also help those who have trouble with the sound adjustments (there are many incorrect one-star reviews) and this is my suggestions to get it right:1) the Sony Bluetooth speaker has settings for bass, mid, and treble. They can be set with the Sony music app or directly in your music app as for example Amazon Music (see attached equalizer picture from within Amazon Music app on my mobile device)2) Make sure there is no competing app on your phone to override sound settings.3) Amazon Music has an equalizer (see attached picture in the app) that you can use with preset genres of music or for custom settings. This one seem better than the Sony Music Center app4) If you have two devices connected to it i.e. a mobile phone and a laptop like i had, make sure to disconnect the laptop in my case, so my mobile phone can control the speaker without interference from another device.Some things to know if you like specs and which you cannot find in the product description, but I wanted to know beforehand (but didn't find):1) Audio range is from 20Hz to 20,000 Hz at a 44.1kHz sampling frequency2) speakers are full range type (20Hz-20kHz 49mm x 71 mm), two speakers in enclosure3) Enclosure type is passive radiator. [Sounds fantastic]4) Bluetooth standard/version is 5.2 spec (Maximum line of sight distance 30 meters)5) Unit has built in microphone so you can use as a speakerphone/conference speaker on the go6) Microphone is omni-directional 100Hz-8000Hz (so covers speech spectrum)7) operating range 5'C - 35'C (so in summer protect from direct sunshine).8) Water and salt water resistant IP-67 standard compliant9) Comes with heavy duty 3A charge cable only, no charger. Will need a 3Ampere USB C port charger. 5 hrs charging time with a 3A charger. Forever with any other... get the correct current capable charger of 3A (or more)10) 10 minutes charging provides 70 minutes playback (if you use the proper 3A charger)Couldn't find anything on music power, but is plenty within a 10 meter vicinity I 'ld say.I recommend the Amazon Music App equalizer over the Sony Music Center App which will allow to adjust (lift/lower) base, middle, treble. There may be third party Equalizer apps that you can explore*.In the Amazon app when you look at your song at the right bottom click on ""..."" (more choices); from there, you'll see the Equalizer to go to. Click on it and you get the screen with the frequency levers to lift or reduce a limited band of audio frequencies (see attached image and video on how to do it and impact).If the video sounds poorly out of your laptop it is your lap top, not the speaker nor the recording. On that one you have to trust me :) .*= I found a third party equalizer called ""SOUND Beautifier"" which can be downloaded in the Android Play Store free of charge. Play Amazon Music then open this app and ""beautify"" your sound (at this point this app will overwrite your Amazon Music equalizer settings). Very easy to use, though I prefer a traditional equalizer look/function. See attached screenshot for this app. I like it though. Easy to maximize sound to your liking.Total awesome astonishing sound for a mobile unit. Recommend strongly.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AE4EXBSSEW4FGE4IXEIH2PHCW7XA,0,1,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE300,"March 26, 2024",2024-03-26,2024-03,Sony,nan
R3K6AQGK1L36VO,B0B445JCZ3,5.0 out of 5 stars SRS-XE300 - SRS-XG300 - SRS-XG500 review,Marco.,5.0,"I'm going to submit the same review for all three speakers. The reason I'm doing that is because my plan is to use them in my backyard around the pool in a party/group configuration.Each speaker has its pros and cons obviously. But I'm going to speak about the size, weight and sound compared to each other. All three have excellent build quality and look really sharp. Each has a really nice fabric accompanied with rubberized plastic that's easy to grip. Each unit also had a nice heavy/dense feel to it. I'm assuming that's attributed to battery size, considering the runtime that these are stated to have. I have not tested the endurance of the batteries yet but will follow up with that as I know more.SRS-XE300 X-Series: this one really punches above its weight. The sound for such a small speaker is actually really good. And it has a surprising amount of bass for its size and the clarity of the treble is wonderful. The configuration of the speaker openings are quite strange on this model, and you wouldn‚Äôt think it would be effective but it really sounds good but correct physical placement of the speaker is the key to get great lows-mids-highs from this. I was quite surprised at the quality of sound for the lowest price.SRS-XG300 X-Series: this is a nice sounding speaker and it really has a great size and weight to it. I was a little disappointed as I thought that it should have had a lot more bass compared to the SRS-XE300 but it does have a sufficient amount. Maybe the smaller XE300 just surprised me with the amount of bass that it has? I ordered a package unit that included a case that is of decent quality. The nice part about the case is that it has a small compartment to house the included USB C charging unit.SRS-XG500 X-Series: this thing is really stout and gets really loud if that's what you want, while still sounding great. For a speaker the size of an old style boombox, the bass will thump your skull. One of the cons for this model is that it doesn't charge via USB C. It uses a barrel tip charger while the other two use USB C. It would be nice if Sony made them all consistent. And compared to the other 2 speakers, this one feels like the battery isn‚Äôt as heavy in comparison to its size. Not sure if that will impact battery life as I‚Äôve not tested that yet.The first time I tried the party/group speaker configuration the sound volume was imbalanced out of each speaker. The way to rectify that is to turn the volume to zero on your Bluetooth device after you've created the group to level-set their volumes at 0. At that point all of their volumes should stay in sync when you volume up via Bluetooth.Full disclosure, I bought the XE300 and the XG500 refurbished. The XG300 was brand new. The refurbished models that I bought were in excellent shape.

The company I worked for made bluetooth speakers and other audio devices, I have over 15 years of experience in this particular segment (not in the segment anymore).QUICK TAKE - As someone who knows just how hard it is to engineer and design a portable speaker with exceptional battery life, connectivity and pleasing audio my first take on this device is I'm genuinely impressed.The lack of the fifth star is simply because there's not a half-star option to make it a 4.5-star product. The reason for the .5 docking? The mids and highs tend to be a bit overwhelmed with certain types of music.Jazz - Sounds amazing - great separation of instruments and nice tones (especially piano and guitar)Rock - Sounds great - the speaker can handle a lot of sound at onceR&B / Urban - Heavy bass starts to muddy things up a bit - there's no DISTORTION (which is important to note) but the bass can get overwhelming since it's pretty powerful in this model. Bassheads will absolutely love this speaker.Electronica - Same issue as with the R&B / Urban - if it's a bass-heavy track you will lose detail in the mids and highs.The build quality just feels GOOD in your hand. Nice and solid with the silicone outer shell feeling QUALITY and not cheap. The fabric outer edging is also durable and a nice contrast with the silicone shell. I dunked this sucker in an ice tub and it kept on ticking right afterwards - the IP rating makes this one safe to take with you pretty much anywhere.THE GOOD STUFF:- Exceptional build quality - feels good in the hand and a nice weight- EXCELLENT battery life - rated for 24 hours but will be closer to 17-18 at higher volumes (which is still VERY good battery life)- Amazing to use as a bluetooth conference speaker. My colleagues say my voice sounds better over this speaker than on my bluetooth headset (also Sony) and their voices come out crystal clear on calls- USB C Charging (THANK YOU SONY!)- Easy to use controls - very straightforward and easy to engage- Good audio quality (see comments above) - bordering on excellent with bass tones being a bit overbearing at higher volumes- Sony Music Center APP allows you to tune the speaker and is easy to set up (which does help with some of the bass overdrive, DEFINITELY download this if you purchase, you won't regret it)- When STEREO mode is enabled in APP it adds a much better separation of audio on the speaker (game changer)THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF:- Can be bass-heavy with specific types of music at higher volumes- Stereo separation could be better - but honestly for an outdoor by the pool speaker battery life and volume are keys to enjoying this one - it DOES outperform some of the smaller and popular other Bluetooth portable speakers quite handily though- You really need the app to tune this speaker to make it shine - there's no on device controls to fine tune the audio profile (DEFINITELY TURN ON STEREO MODE - default comes in Mono)WORTH IT? As I said earlier, this speaker impresses. I REALLY wish there was a .5 star option so I could give this one the extra .5, but since people are spending their money I err on the side of caution. I have a pretty huge selection of Bluetooth Speakers to choose from here at home and this model is now my favorite one in its size range. The long battery life and audio quality are great and the product just FEELS like its going to last given the exceptional build quality. Definitely worth a purchase if you're looking for something to have by the pool, take camping, or even a pretty amazing speakerphone for work and team calls.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2022",AEHVVCJCB3YGAYXDM4DCQ6LT75IA,0,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE300,"September 10, 2022",2022-09-10,2022-09,Sony,nan

That‚Äôs assuming you will be listing to music on this, and taking it places with you. The battery life is 33% larger, lasting a full 24 hours of music playback at half volume. The sound quality is better and more impactful. I really enjoyed listening with this speaker and the smaller one was more ‚Äújust ok‚Äù sounding. I like that the Music Center app (on iOS/Android) supports this speaker and lets you control playback, adjust sound settings, and update the firmware.I think that the current $150 price makes this a decent value if you appreciate having above average sound quality, quick charging, app support, Google fast pair, and other quality-of-life features you wouldn‚Äôt get on a more budget-oriented Bluetooth speaker from a less prominent name brand in electronics. The one disappointment with this product is a lack of 3.5mm headphone jack, for auxiliary connections.

R247PZTMWZ2EI9,B0B445JCZ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars BIG speaker, great sound",Austin,4.0,"When I unboxed this speaker I was surprised how large it was. Our Bluetooth speaker we used for years before was a Bose Soundlink and this one is at least twice the size of that. It‚Äôs got a smooth feel to it and a nice design with speakers that wrap around from top to bottom. I like how you can stand it up vertical or set it down horizontal depending on where you want to place it.I mostly play Spotify music from my phone and this will get pretty loud but the music remains crisp. I would compare the sound output to the newest Echo (the large one, not the Dot). The bass isn‚Äôt anything special in my opinion. You can control the volume from either the speaker itself or your phone but one thing I noticed is you can‚Äôt set the speaker to a certain volume and then control it differently from your phone. What I mean is if you wanted the speaker to be about 50% when your phone is turned up to 100%, that‚Äôs not possible. Min and max volume on your phone is the same min and max volume on the speaker. I like how there‚Äôs a battery button that when you click it, it will tell you how much battery is left. For example, ‚Äúbattery about 40%‚Äù.Overall a sleek looking speaker that‚Äôs easy to charge and has a long lasting battery. It‚Äôs definitely on the heavier side and with it being such a big device, it might be a little difficult to pack for trips, depending on how much space you have. The sound quality is good but I expected a little more from Sony. It‚Äôs a large device so I would think it could get a little louder than it does, but still plenty loud to fill a room. Overall a quality speaker, little high on price but pretty comparable to other well-know brands.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AEUNG334KUZWXHHAIRMJXCBT5FYA,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE300,"September 22, 2022",2022-09-22,2022-09,Sony,nan
R350GMFJ1HT1E4,B0B445JCZ3,4.0 out of 5 stars Rugged all-weather Bluetooth speaker.,Jane Fairchild,4.0,"This Bluetooth speaker from Sony is waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof making it the perfect ally whenever you're on the go.Its a good size, not especially small, but still small enough to fit into a backpack easily. It fits nicely on a tabletop and can be used either laying down or standing up.There's a decent range of volume available, but its not the speaker for you if you're looking to party all the time. Its just not designed for that.The sound quality is also not the greatest, but its okay. Sound is a little flat, and there's a notable absence of highs and upper mids.But this speaker wasn't meant for audiophile level sound reproduction. Instead its a great speaker to take with you wherever you go without having to worry about dropping it or getting it wet.So far I've used it in the kitchen while cooking up a meal. I'm a messy chef so there's splashing and food everywhere. While I haven't dropped it yet, it doesn't feel especially vulnerable.The controls are easy to press even with dirty hands. And the exterior is easy to wipe clean.Bluetooth pairing with multiple devices went off without a hitch, and switching between the devices was seamless as well.So far battery life has been very good.Overall, I'm looking forward to having it on hand.

R1KPGGGBENB2AG,B0B445JCZ3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very good speaker, could use better high end",Goodeknight,4.0,"Took me a few minutes to figure out this speaker sounds best lying on its side.The speaker has really nice sound, including pretty good bass, but it could use a little more high-end. It's lacking a good tweeter. Still, overall, it produces very good sound quality, even at max volume. Little or no distortion.It has some weight to it, and feels very sturdy, like it could handle a drop from a few feet. That's good, especially for something that will be mobile. It's supposed to be able to handle full submersion in water up to 3 ft for half an hour. I'll take Sony's word for that, because I'm not going to test it myself. So I assume it could very easily withstand a little drizzle or sea spray, or even a heavy rain.I won't be downloading any apps for this, but it was easy enough to connect my phone to it via Bluetooth.By size and weight, this is somewhere between the little portable speakers, and modern style boomboxes with a handle. The sound is right in the middle of that range, too. You're not going to get the same volume or sound profile as a 60 watt boombox, but it will be far superior to most typical (smaller) portable speakers.If that's what you were looking for, I would recommend this.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AGGTFQA6YQFVAAQ7YPOUEQ6NAKAQ,0,1,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE300,"September 9, 2022",2022-09-09,2022-09,Sony,nan

I was very pleased overall with the durability and sound of this speaker. In a portable speaker, I want durability. This speaker definitely fits the bill. It is IP67 waterproof/dustproof/shockproof which is perfect for my needs. I don't have to be really paranoid about anything of that natue messing this speaker up easily. The charge port is even securely hidden by a rubber flap. The buttons are flush and integrated into the speaker body which I like.The sound of this speaker really carries. I have a small house. When this speaker is cranked up, I can hear it from anywhere in my house clearly. It's reminiscent of the sound of a stereo system rather than a portable speaker. That being said, the speaker doesn't have as much bass behind it as I would have liked. The Sony Music Center App does allow you to mess with EQ settings which helps some, but would have liked to have more bass overall. This speaker can also be used as a speakerphone to take calls which is an added bonus. Battery life has been very good, with a reasonable charge time.Overall, this speaker has loud, crisp stereo like sound, is easy to use/set up, and is ""IP67 life resistant"" so you don't have to worry as much about it when using it on the go.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2022",AHC2NI7LIVUJYCFAIXBPANTPTPQQ,0,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE300,"November 15, 2022",2022-11-15,2022-11,Sony,nan

There is no rgb, this is a no gimmicks portable speaker and all business. It feels great and is rated for 3ft of water for 30mins, dust tight, and feels like it would survive a drop. Functionality the ex300 is fantastic. It picks up bluetooth instantly and is fast enough for no noticeable lag. Many sound bars handle this worse. The performance of the 300 is ahead of the 200. The 300 for example offers strong bass, something the 200 completely lacks. It won't beat an actual base, but it is surprisingly good. The speaker functions best horizontally. This is because the stereo would come from the top and bottom if it was vertical rather than right and left. This is completely unavoidable in any speak like this. It is nice it offers the versatility The sound is decent, not jaw dropping, but really decent. It can get loud, it sounds a little muffled but is better than some sound bars for the same money. Then you take into account this has a 17hr real-time battery life, and then you should realize this is a speaker for the pool, camping, BBQ , projector, or fishing trip.

From the substantial feel of this speaker to the initial tones when you power it on for the first time, everything screams quality.Once you get it turned on and connected, the real fun begins. This speaker is loud and has a very nice bass presence. Is it going to over-power someone with a huge PA system? No. But it is loud enough that if you set it on your picnic table or on the towel on the beach in the middle of your gathering, you need to be careful to not have it on too loud, or you won't hear your friends and family talking!Bluetooth is super simple to connect, and while it's not necessary, there are Sony apps available for free to enhance your experience with this XE300.While Sony says sound is multi-directional, I found this to be about 90% true; there is one direction where it is obviously louder, but that's to be expected with a speaker like this.

R1JXO6CVJN9WUI,B0B445JCZ3,3.0 out of 5 stars Missing Features,A. Antonio,3.0,"Sony usually makes excellent audio equipment and they charge a premium for it. In this case, they made a few missteps.SOUNDThe out of the box sound quality is surprisingly subpar. It sounds muddled and it's VERY heavy on the bass. If you download their Music Center app, which is separate from their Headphones app, you can turn on ClearAudio+. This helps a lot. It improves the muddling, but it's still heavy on the bass. If you turn on ClearAudio+ you can't turn down the bass.APPThe app is okay, but it demands the question - Why is there a Music Center and a Headphones app? They could easily be combined. Together they would make a decent app, but apart they both lack features and you won't use them often.BUILDThe build is up to Sony's standards. It's solid and has a good weight to it. There is no evidence of corners being cut.FEATURESThere is where this speaker gets a big ding. Other speakers in a similar price range have better features. For instance - reverse charging and aux input are not present in this speaker. A similar speaker from JBL has those options, at a lower price point. This one is pretty bare bones when it comes to features.BATTERYThe battery life is legit. I've use this to play a few hours of music and roughly 18hrs of standby and phone calls. The battery is only down to 80%. The 24hr claim is for actual playback.SIDE NOTEA lot of speakers fire up, out the sides, or through a series of front facing speakers. This one is a little odd in that regard. This one fires out of the narrow strip of fabric. You have to pay attention to what direction that's pointing, as it has a huge impact on the sound.Basically there are better speakers in this price range.

Yes I know they aren't all marketed as equal, but the prices are actually all pretty close (except for the Flare).After connecting them to my Samsung S22 Ultra each, I played 2 different songs on each device. In my opinion the Sony had the worst sound all the four. It sounded cloudy and muffled, even the bass wasn't that good. My wife as well as my 7 year old daughter (who sometimes I think is tone deaf) also choose the Sony speaker as the worst of the 4.I'm not sure if this can be fixed by a firmware update or maybe we just got a bad speaker but I was very surprised on how bad the sound was.I can't really recommend this portable speaker at all.P.S.

R3LB9TE0T86PNZ,B0B445JCZ3,3.0 out of 5 stars The SRS-XE300 Didn't Meet my Expectations,Rob S,3.0,"*Please note this is a review for the larger SRS-XE300.*I purchased this looking for a midsize travel speaker to use when carrying around my larger SRS-XG300 (""mini"" boombox) isn't practical - ex. getting on a plane.Being so happy with that speaker, I decided to give the SRS-XE300 a try. But...I found myself a bit under-whelmed.PROS:- I was impressed with all the tinkering afforded by the application - my favorite feature in particular are the battery health features that limit charging to 90%: the first and last 10% of discharging/charging a lithium battery are where most of the wear occurs. Since Bluetooth speakers are hard to repair, ensuring battery longevity is important to me. But it does a great job offering lots of other controls over other sound features: stereo vs. mono mode, EQ, etc.- The bass was quite impressive for the size.- I didn't experience much distortion even when cranking it to higher volume levels.CONS -- It seems like this iteration of Sony speaker put a diffuser to help ""direct"" sound out of one side of the speaker - and I found that this significantly degraded treble performance off-axis. I have hearing difficulties, and even after fiddling with the EQ and volume, I was never happy with the clarity of vocals especially if I wasn't standing directly in-line with that opening. Increasing the volume would make it uncomfortably loud. Perhaps it wouldn't have been as big of an issue had I purchased *two* XE300's to make a very directional stereo pair, but at that point the space savings over the XG300 would be moot--not to mention the increase in cost..I ended up returning this for the JBL Flip 6 and that design seems to work better for me, though the bass response is nowhere near as impressive as this nor is the app's feature set.Overall: I think this is worth a try, but personally, if a small size is not a factor, I would HIGHLY recommend making the jump up to the SRS-XG300 - now THAT is a kickass speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2023",AHJAWRVYPW5TE5OANZVMFQVE4HZQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE300,"September 9, 2023",2023-09-09,2023-09,Sony,nan
R1DAHK2RQS1SII,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars This is the IT speaker,Noah,5.0,"Firstly, I must say that the sound quality is absolutely incredible. These speakers provide an immersive audio experience, allowing you to truly feel the music and get lost in its rhythm. Whether you're enjoying your tunes or cranking up the volume for a dance party, this speaker is guaranteed to impress. The bass is deep and punchy, adding that extra kick to your music.One aspect that really stood out to me is its portability. Despite its powerful sound output, this speaker is surprisingly compact and lightweight. You can effortlessly carry it with you wherever you go, be it a picnic or a fun beach gathering. Moreover, with its IP67 rating, it's designed to withstand dust and water, making it ideal for all kinds of escapades.Connecting to this speaker couldn't be easier thanks to its Bluetooth functionality. Pairing it with my phone was a breeze, and I experienced no issues with the connection throughout my usage. Furthermore, the speaker offers a range that grants me freedom of movement without any concerns about losing connectivity.Battery life is always a concern when using speakers; however, the Sony SRS-XG300 has got you covered in that department. With a 24-hour battery life, you can enjoy music all day and night without needing to worry about recharging. It even comes with a USB port, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices while on the move.Finally, the design is sleek and contemporary. It's evident that Sony has meticulously considered every aspect, from the construction to the user controls. The LED lights bring an element that enhances the atmosphere and perfectly complements the music.If you're looking for a great speaker for a little more price this is the one.

First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,1,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H,"July 15, 2024",2024-07-15,2024-07,Sony,nan

It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8.

I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here? Well, I think for the most part yes.

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price.

R2LKEYDZ9Q0Z57,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Buy for outdoor needs,KnightFox,5.0,I switched to this speaker after using the waterproof JBL speaker. Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn‚Äôt specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product.

Parks,4.0,"This review is for the XG300 model overall the speaker looks awesome and I really like the handle the sound quality is good it has that Sony sound but the output is pretty lackluster for a speaker of this size and weight. It definitely gets pretty loud I was just expecting louder I paid 199US for this speaker and I think it's a fair price, at the MSRP of $349 absolutely not. Overall I don't see much improvement over the XB43 other than it's looks and the handle. The live sound mode is pretty good also for certain listening experiences.Just bumped it up from 3 stars to 5 for a few reasons the sound quality has definitely improved over the months I've owned it and the battery life on this thing is amazing. It's had several updates and literally everything on the speaker is improved now. Even with LDAC enabled in Bluetooth settings the battery still goes all day. If you can get this for under $200 it's a awesome speaker!","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2023",AGOB5SI6TWNYCX4LSTSER2XB2LQQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B,"January 9, 2023",2023-01-09,2023-01,Sony,nan

This sounds GREAT, but is just the same on a bigger and louder scale. For reviews that hated the ""disco"" lights on the side, those can be turned off. There is a switch in the charge area. Gorgeous looking speaker. Time will tell how the fabric holds up, but manual says it can be washed with water. I bought a case for it also. Note that this is BIG, and that it is not the kind of speaker that can get tossed in a backpack. More of a party speaker. I think that Sonys are really the best speakers out there, and this does not disappoint. There also is a battery health saving mode that does not let it fully charge.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse.

Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you‚Äôve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it‚Äôs okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don‚Äôt try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you‚Äôre pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I‚Äôm missing the mark on its intended use, but I don‚Äôt think so. For small sound and high portability, it‚Äôs okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I‚Äôll have to sample it for a while and along others. I‚Äôm on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I‚Äôll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it‚Äôs pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it‚Äôs been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it‚Äôs worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,1,0,Color: White,"July 8, 2024",2024-07-08,2024-07,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker

If you only want one speaker it is ok but the JBL Flip 6 at $99 is just as good.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2024",AFNED7OI2U3V2GPP6XHXMYQY5R6Q,0,0,Color: White,"May 22, 2024",2024-05-22,2024-05,Sonos,Sonos Roam 2 - Portable Waterproof Speaker
