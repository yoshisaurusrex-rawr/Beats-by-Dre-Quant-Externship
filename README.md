Just a little README so that you can gain an understanding of what this repository is:

It contains the code and deliverables for my Quantitative and Qualitative Insights Analysis for Beats by Dre, hosted by Extern. 
I got to explore the customer journey roadmap, the AIDA framework, sharpen my skills in Python (numpy, seaborn, pandas) and further develop my analytical mind by pulling insights from numbers and datapoints that, at first glance, could mean anything.
